Suggestions from Project Gutenberg Founder Michael Hart\\n\\nTrouble downloading? In late September 2023 we began getting reports from people\\nusing Google Chrome who could no longer download EPUB or other formats. This\\nseems to be due to a change in Chrome. Instead, try right-clicking then use the\\n“Save as…” or similar menu to save to your computer. Or, try using a different\\nweb browser.\\n\\n\\nPROJECT GUTENBERG IS NOT JUST FOR YOUR DESKTOP OR NOTEBOOK COMPUTER!\\n\\nAll modern tablets, smartphones, and eBook readers we know about can display\\nProject Gutenberg eBooks. We are not going to try to list them all here, but\\nevery such device we are aware of has the ability to display one or more of\\nProject Gutenberg’s typical file formats. Many MP3 players, gaming systems, and\\nother devices can display eBooks, too. The Project Gutenberg site offers\\ndownload formats suitable for eBook readers, mobile phones, and other devices.\\n\\nThere are several different ways of obtaining and viewing the titles, and most\\npeople will be able to choose whichever suits them best. Before getting started,\\ncheck with your device’s documentation to determine which formats you can\\ndisplay. This page [/help/file_formats.html] lists the formats that Project\\nGutenberg offers.\\n\\nHere are some of the ways we know of to get Project Gutenberg eBooks to your\\neBook reader or mobile phone:\\n\\n 1. Read the eBook online. All the devices we know about have the ability to\\n    display Web pages, and that is one of the formats available for nearly every\\n    Project Gutenberg eBook.\\n 2. Download eBooks directly to your device over the Internet. If your device is\\n    Internet-enabled, just visit the catalog landing page for a book, and\\n    download one of the formats your device can display. Here is a sample\\n    catalog landing page: www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11 [/ebooks/11]. Use the\\n    author/title search boxes on every page at www.gutenberg.org to find eBooks\\n    you are interested in.\\n 3. Download to your computer, and transfer (i.e., “side load”) to your device.\\n    This might be done with a USB cable, Bluetooth, or another method.\\n 4. Use a third party site or app (including some for-fee sites or apps), which\\n    facilitate getting files onto your device. Note that Project Gutenberg does\\n    not have any apps, and there are never logins or fees from Project\\n    Gutenberg.\\n 5. Other methods, as supported by your device. For example, the Kindle supports\\n    an email method to transform and receive files.\\n\\n\\nSEARCH FOR GUIDANCE\\n\\nMany articles have been written on different approaches to getting Project\\nGutenberg content onto different devices. Use your favorite search site to look\\nfor guidance. These include articles on specific devices, as well on how convert\\nGutenberg files to other formats. We don’t try to maintain a list of links here,\\nsince the articles tend to evolve rapidly as new devices and software come out.\\nInstead, use your favorite web search engine to find the details you need.\\n\\nThese Wikipedia links have information, listings, and comparisons that may be\\nuseful:\\n\\n * Comparison of e-readers\\n   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_e-readers]\\n * Comparison of e-book formats\\n   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_e-book_formats]\\n * Comparison of Android e-reader software\\n   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Android_e-reader_software]\\n * Comparison of iOS e-reader software\\n   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_iOS_e-reader_software]\\n\\n\\nGENERAL ADVICE\\n\\nThere are a few different challenges that many people face. Here are some of the\\nones we hear about most often. Keep in mind that there are many different types\\nof devices people use to access and read Project Gutenberg’s eBooks, and they\\ncan be set up differently and have different software. So, your specific\\nexperience might be a little different than someone else’s. This also means that\\nstep-by-step instructions might need some variation for your own situation.\\n\\nSave an eBook to transfer to your device. If you are using your computer to look\\nat an eBook, you can save the eBook’s file(s) to your computer so that you can\\ncopy it to your device. Try the “File / Save as…” … “HTML Complete” or similar\\noption in your Web browser to save the file(s) to a folder you choose, so that\\nyou can later transfer the files to your device. If you want to get a particular\\nfile format (often the EPUB format), from the Project Gutenberg download page\\nyou can right-click to get a pop-up menu, then “save as…” (or a similar option).\\nIf you don’t have a right mouse button (on some Macs), use control-click to get\\nthe pop-up menu.\\n\\nFor HTML, make sure you save the complete page. Some Web browsers just download\\nthe HTML (the text), and link back to the images at the www.gutenberg.org site.\\nThis won’t work reliably, since viewing the book woudl then require you to be\\nonline. Project Gutenberg wants you to have the WHOLE eBook - download the\\ncomplete HTML with images. All Web browsers offer this as a menu option, but it\\nmight not be the default choice.\\n\\nWhere is the file? If you simply click a file to download, you might get a\\ndialog box or something similar, asking whether you want to save the file. But\\nwhere did it go? It seems there are many different places your computer or\\nreader might save the file, and they can be hard to find later. Use the “save\\nas…” method mentioned above to choose a specific location. Also, keep in mind\\nthat the Project Gutenberg files might have names that don’t related to the\\nbook’s title (we use a numeric file naming scheme based on the eBook number).\\nYou can rename the files to anything you’d like, but you will first need to know\\nwhere they are saved.\\n\\nOn tablets and ereaders, you might not be prompted for where to save your file,\\nand we have had reports of different locations being used from time to time, or\\nby different software. You might need to look around in your downloaded files\\nareas.\\n\\nGet the file to my device. This varies quite a bit, but the first step is to\\nfind where you saved the file (sometimes you can save directly to your device,\\nif it is connected). One common variation is to connect your device to your\\ncomputer, often with a USB cable. This is called “tethering.” Then, just drag\\nand drop (or use another method for copying files) to put the file on your\\ndevice - this is often called “side loading.” Another common variation is to use\\na separate program that manages your device’s content, and to open the file and\\ntransfer it from within that program. Calibre is a good example of free software\\nthat works on many different devices and can help you to manage your eBook\\nlibrary.\\n\\nHey, it doesn’t look right! Project Gutenberg relies on several automated steps\\nto create EPUB and other eBook reader formats. For a variety of reasons, this\\nautomation sometimes yields files that don’t look right on every device,\\nparticularly those with small screens. One common problem is to have lots of\\nwhite space at the top of an eBook, or very wide margins. Also, it might be that\\nimages (from the HTML version of the book) are not included in the\\nautomatically-generated version. If you got the right file, but it doesn’t look\\nright, it’s probably not something you can fix. Try another file format,\\nespecially HTML or plain text. HTML and plain text can be viewed by many of the\\nspecialized eBook reader devices and mobile phones.\\n\\nI get an error that the file is protected by DRM Digital Rights Management,\\nwhich is a way that some publishers use to prevent you from doing what you want\\nwith files they produce. Nothing in Project Gutenberg has DRM. But we’ve found\\nthat if a file is corrupted or changed, some devices mistakenly think they are\\nprotected by DRM. Try downloading again, or try different reading software (if\\npossible), or try another file format.\\n\\n\\nKINDLE\\n\\n\\nGENERAL KINDLE HELP\\n\\nAmazon makes it challenging to know what transfer method, and which file\\nformats, are supported for your specific setup. Since late 2022, Amazon has\\nshifted to prefer the new K8 or AZW format rather than MOBI, and has also\\nincreased support for the EPUB format.\\n\\nFirst consider using EPUB (specifically, EPUB version 3 or EPUB3), rather than\\nKindle (K8) formats. The EPUB files are smaller and supported by the Kindle app\\nand most Kindle devices. You can also use “send to Kindle” with EPUB.\\n\\nVisit the Amazon help pages for your specific Kindle model. The help pages for\\nthe devices we looked all have a page describing how to transfer files from your\\ncomputer to your Kindle, which is sometimes called “side loading.” Side loading\\nusually seems to work most reliably: save to your computer, and then copy to\\nyour device. Here is Amazon’s device help page\\n[http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200127470].\\n\\nThere are too many different products, with sometimes differing software or\\nfeatures, for us to keep up. Your best solution will be to look for guidance for\\nyour specific situation. Amazon seems to remove support for some capabilities\\nfrom older Kindles, including web browser support for the modern secure web\\n(https).\\n\\nAn alternative to side loading is to use Amazon’s “Send to Kindle”\\nfunctionality. You can find Amazon’s information about this at\\namazon.com/sendtokindle [https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle].\\n\\nTo send a Project Gutenberg eBook to your Kindle using this method, you must\\nfirst visit the site above and tell Amazon what email address(es) you want to\\nenable to email content to your Kindle. You also need to determine your personal\\nKindle email address from the site above or your Kindle’s settings page.\\n\\nThen, download the Project Gutenberg eBook to a computer or tablet that you can\\nsend email from. The EPUB and Kindle (KF8) formats work fine, and you can also\\nsend PDF, plain text, and some other formats found at Project Gutenberg. Just\\nemail that file to your send to Kindle address. You then need to visit the\\nAmazon page again to authorize receiving the file. It will then be automatically\\nprocessed and will soon arrive on your wifi-connected Kindle.\\n\\nBeware that Amazon sells many titles in print and digital format that you can\\nget freely from Project Gutenberg. In addition, we have found that Amazon\\noutsources many of their own digital imprints, and sometimes their non-free\\ntitles violate the Project Gutenberg trademark. Project Gutenberg has never\\nreceived any trademark royalty payments from Amazon or Amazon resellers or\\nimprints. For older content that is in the public domain in the U.S., there is a\\ngood chance that Project Gutenberg has it free of charge, but Amazon will charge\\nmoney for it. Of course there might be advantages to the non-free version (such\\nas better formatting). Be aware, and make an informed choice.\\n\\n\\nALTERNATE APPS AND FORMATS\\n\\nMany or all Kindles allow you to install alternate eBook reader software. Advice\\nwe have received (which might need adjustment for your specific device, or if\\nsome versions of software are updated from when these instructions were\\nwritten): you may be able to install a third party EPUB reader and start\\ndownloading the EPUB files instead of the Kindle files from Project Gutenberg.\\nYou may want to read up on installing third party apps on the Kindle you have.\\nAdvantages of EPUB files over Kindle files include: that they are much smaller\\nthan Kindle files and that they work on many other types of ereaders.\\n\\n\\nNOOK\\n\\nThe Barnes & Noble “Nook” devices seem to work well with Project Gutenberg\\ntitles, including the different versions (Color etc.). Note that to connect for\\ntethering and side loading, your Nook needs to be awake (use the on-screen\\nslider to do this, you’ll get a message that it is connected to your computer).\\nOther points for the Nook:\\n\\n * You can use the built-in Web browser to look at Project Gutenberg eBooks in\\n   text and HTML format, but the browser will not display EPUB or the other\\n   common Project Gutenberg download formats.\\n * Instead, use your computer’s Web browser to find and download EPUB or other\\n   formats. Use the techniques described elsewhere on this page. There does not\\n   seem to be a way to download those formats to your Nook without going through\\n   your computer or the online Nook store.\\n\\nBeware that there are many Barnes & Noble titles in print and eBooks that are\\nnot free from them, but are free from Project Gutenberg. B&N often adds a\\n“Copyright” statement to such old books (for example, Pride and Prejudice, which\\nactually was included with the Nook we tried), but only things like the cover\\nand introduction are copyrighted, the main text is not. For older content (95+\\nyears since publication), there is a good chance that Project Gutenberg has it\\nfor free, but B&N will charge money for it. Of course there might be advantages\\nto the non-free version (such as better formatting). Be aware, and make an\\ninformed choice.\\n\\n\\nKOBO READER\\n\\nKobo has had positive reviews, and is less restrictive about where it gets\\ncontent than devices from B&N and Amazon.\\n\\nPutting a Project Gutenberg EPUB file onto a Kobo couldn’t be easier. Connect\\nyour Kobo to your computer, then drag and drop the EPUB from your computer to\\nthe Kobo. When you disconnect your Kobo, it will automatically ingest the EPUB,\\nand add it to “My Books.”\\n\\nThe Kobo [https://www.kobo.com/] reader online store includes free access to 100\\nof the most popular Project Gutenberg titles. You need to go through the\\nregistration process to get access to the store. Direct transfer of downloaded\\neBooks from a computer to the Kobo did not immediately work for us, but is\\nsupposed to be supported. The Kobo supports PDF and EPUB formats, and has a\\nsimple built-in Web browser that can be used to read eBooks online. Project\\nGutenberg would like to thank Kobo for providing free evaluation readers in\\n2010.\\n\\n\\nANDROID\\n\\nThe Android operating system is found on many phones and tablets. The specific\\nfeatures and applications vary, and there are often customizations to Android\\nthat change functionality. Android devices include Web browsers that can be used\\nto read Project Gutenberg’s text and HTML eBooks online.\\n\\nFor other file types, you can try copying from your computer to the device as\\ndescribed above. Or, you might be able to download or view directly on your\\nAndroid. Use the Google Play Store or a similar source for searching for apps,\\nto find ways to download and display EPUB or other files. We have had many\\npositive reports of the app Calibre [https://calibre-ebook.com].\\n\\n\\nIPAD, IPHONE AND IPOD TOUCH\\n\\nYour regular Web browser (Safari, etc.) can read Project Gutenberg eBooks\\nonline.\\n\\nIf you prefer to download, instead of reading online, the fastest way to get\\nProject Gutenberg ebooks onto your iOS device is to use the built-in browser to\\ndownload the EPUB format and then “open in” the preferred application.\\n\\nYou can also get Project Gutenberg’s eBook files onto the iPad using iTunes or\\nother programs that transfer files to your device. This works for EPUB files,\\nand it also works well for Project Gutenberg’s MP3 audio eBooks.\\n\\nWe have received this specific set of instructions from a reader. They might not\\nwork exactly on your iPad, and are intended to illustrate the general process.\\nThey assume you have installed the Amazon Kindle app from Apple’s app store -\\nthis is only one of many applications that can display Kindle (KF8) or\\nEPUB-formatted files - different applications would utilize similar steps:\\n\\n 1.  Choose “Kindle” (KF8) or EPUB option for book download from Project\\n     Gutenberg\\n 2.  Click on “More”\\n 3.  Choose “Save to Files”\\n 4.  Choose “On my iPad” and select a document app such as File Explorer\\n     (available in Apple’s app store)\\n 5.  Click “Add” (at this point you can then you can disconnect from the\\n     Internet)\\n 6.  Open the “Files” app\\n 7.  Select “On my iPad”\\n 8.  Select the document app where you put file\\n 9.  Press and hold the .epub file to reveal menu, and then press “Share”\\n 10. Select “Copy to Kindle,” and the book will now be in your library.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg would like to thank Apple for providing devices for evaluation\\nin 2009 and 2010.\\n\\n\\nREMARKABLE2\\n\\nThe reMarkable 2 is an ereader that became commonly available in 2022.\\nCapabilities for adding Project Gutenberg eBooks, or content from other sources,\\nmay improve in the future.\\n\\nA reader reported that these steps worked. This is assuming you are using a\\nsmartphone for website navigation, and the smartphone is paired or connected to\\nthe reMarkable 2 device, with the reMarkable app installed; this would probably\\nalso work with a tablet, rather than a phone:\\n\\n 1. Select an eBook from Project Gutenberg.\\n 2. Choose the EPUB format (with or without images).\\n 3. Send to your Google Drive username (using the green/yellow/blue triangle\\n    icon in the book landing page, to the right of the EPUB link).\\n 4. Open the “Google Drive” app on the phone.\\n 5. Select “Open with…” (i.e., three horizontal dots under the book image in\\n    Google Drive, or similar).\\n 6. Select the reMarkable app\\n 7. The EPUB should then appear within the phone’s reMarkable app, and on the\\n    reMarkable 2 device itself.\\n\\nThe Google Drive and Open/Share process is a little different on Android versus\\niPhone.\\n\\nThere are some Project Gutenberg eBooks that, mysteriously, do not display\\nproperly on the reMarkable 2. We have had similar reports with some Kindle\\ndevices, and are contantly making improvements to the software that Project\\nGutenberg utilizes to make these formats. Contact us (link at the bottom of this\\npage) to report any specific anomalies - these reports are really valuable for\\nknowing what to fix!\\n\\n\\nSUGGESTIONS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG FOUNDER MICHAEL HART\\n\\n> Michael Hart was a proponent of eBooks on mobile devices. He offered these\\n> ideas in February 2010. This guidance might not be directly applicable to all\\n> of today’s portable devices.\\n> \\n> I’m writing this because 90% of the questions we receive at help @ pglaf.org\\n> are about buying dedicated eReaders at prices from $200 to over $1,000.\\n> \\n> Before actually plunking down that much money, I suggest trying reading\\n> Project Gutenberg and other eBooks on the laptops, notebooks, netbooks,\\n> cellphones or PDAs already in your collection of devices. I have known many\\n> people who have read very lengthy works on their cellphone, PDA or whatever\\n> while standing in lines over a period of one or two weeks and are have thus\\n> doubled their book number per year without taking any extra time.\\n> \\n> If you adjust the font, color, size, etc., you should be able to find a decent\\n> reading experience for yourself.\\n> \\n> WARNING: DO NOT BUY A CELLPHONE WITHOUT WIFI, they will just jack up your bill\\n> but wifi costs little or nothing.\\n> \\n> If you insist on getting a dedicated ereader, I’m afraid we don’t ever get\\n> into recommending specific products on Project Gutenberg, even those we like\\n> the best/use most.\\n> \\n> However, we do sometimes post reviews.\\n> \\n> In my own experiences in electronics over some 55 years, it has been obvious\\n> that the greatest value lies in some products that include multiple functions,\\n> such as what a hifi person would call a “receiver” which includes amps,\\n> preamps, equalizers, tuners and various other functions. Each amp, preamp,\\n> equalizer and tuner could be had quite readily as a separate box with a\\n> separate power supply– complete with it’s own transformer, AC cord, box,\\n> panels and and decorations, knobs, lights, etc.\\n> \\n> Believe it or not, if you look at the inventory of parts of any of these items\\n> it is the pretty front panel costs the most, then the knobs, then the ugly box\\n> with the big clunky power supply that converts the AC to DC, etc.\\n> \\n> I apologize, but I can’t remember all the details, but I was totally astounded\\n> at finding out that was quite true in whole general hifi world. . .the actual\\n> parts that in reality created the “value” cost the least.\\n> \\n> As a result, the first computer I ever bought was like a hifi receiver in\\n> respects, as it had everything in a big chassis that held the monitor, drives,\\n> printer, cards in one with the keyboard above the motherboard. It did not take\\n> as much space, it did not require as many cables or other interfaces, it took\\n> only one AC socket, and, every single part was completely adjusted to the\\n> system.\\n> \\n> I have built computers totally from parts many time, and done the same with\\n> many other electronics and I’ve never been a fan of having all the separate\\n> boxes. However, I must admit that the very best, if you are going to spend as\\n> much on each box as I was spending on entire systems, are available only in\\n> separate boxes. . .but one connect that doesn’t work right can ruin the whole\\n> thing.\\n\\n * Privacy policy [/policy/privacy_policy.html]\\n * About Project Gutenberg [/about/]\\n * Terms of Use [/policy/terms_of_use.html]\\n * Contact Information [/about/contact_information.html]\\n * Get Help [/help/]\\n\\niBiblio [/gutenberg/ibiblio-logo.png] https://www.ibiblio.org/\"}"}}
