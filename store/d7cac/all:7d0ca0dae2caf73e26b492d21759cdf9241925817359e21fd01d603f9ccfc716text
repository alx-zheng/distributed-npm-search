Please visit the\\ncontact information [/about/contact_information.html] page for the current\\ncorrect email address to send reports to.\\n\\nIt is important to report the full title, author, and eBook number of the text\\nyou are correcting. We have multiple editions of some texts, like Homer’s\\n“Odyssey,” and unless you tell us exactly what eBook you mean we have to spend\\nmuch time searching and guessing which file you were reading. It is important to\\nspecify that you are reporting errors found in the text, html, .mobi or .epub\\nfile.\\n\\nIt is usually easiest to cut and paste the line where the error is into your\\ne-mail, with your comment.\\n\\nA report for a typical errata list might look like:\\n\\n\\nThe Odyssey, by Homer\\n         April, 1999  [EBook #1728]\\n\\n      Line 884:\\n        back Telemachus, who bas now resided there for a month.\\n          \\\"bas\\\" should be \\\"has\\\"\\n\\n      Line 1491:\\n        Ithaca yet stands. But I wouldask thee, friend, concerning\\n           \\\"would\\\" and \\\"ask\\\" are run together here\\n\\n      Line 1563:\\n        in his father's seat and the elders gave place to him\\n           This is the end of a paragraph, and needs a period at end.\\n\\n      Line 15346-7:\\n         'Hearken to me now, ye men of Ithaca, to the\\n         will say. Through your own cowardice, my friends, have\\n            I think there is something missing between \\\"the\\\" and \\\"will\\\"\\n\\n\\nBut the following gets the job done:\\n\\n\\n      In Homer's Odyssey, EBook #1728,\\n      I found the following errors:\\n\\n      Telemachus, who bas now resided\\n      change \\\"bas\\\" to \\\"has\\\"\\n\\n      But I wouldask thee,\\n      \\\"would ask\\\" run together\\n\\n      and the elders gave place to him\\n      needs period\\n\\n      ye men of Ithaca, to the\\n      will say.\\n      line missing between \\\"the\\\" and \\\"will\\\"?\\n\\n\\nOr, even shorter and easiest to use:\\n\\n\\n      In Homer's \\\"Odyssey,\\\" EBook #1728, I found the\\n      following errors:\\n\\n      Telemachus, who bas now resided\\n      bas ==> has\\n\\n      But I wouldask thee,\\n      wouldask ==> would ask\\n\\n      and the elders gave place to him\\n      him ==> him.\\n\\n      ye men of Ithaca, to the\\n      will say.\\n      line or words missing between \\\"the\\\" and \\\"will\\\"?\\n\\n\\nThe common error of copying several lines or the entire paragraph which contains\\nthe error followed by the same paragraph with the error corrected makes it very\\ndifficult and time consuming for the editor to locate the error. Please use one\\nof the errata report formats above.\\n\\nOn the other hand it is also important to give a long enough portion of the line\\nwith the error as there may be dozens of instances of a short phrase.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\\n      to him\\n      him ==> him.\\n\\n\\nmay take 10 minutes or more of the editor’s time searching for “to him” if there\\nare 100 instances of “to him” in the eBook.\\n\\nExperienced Project Gutenberg contributors may find that when there are a great\\nmany suspected errors it may be easiest all round just to submit a corrected\\nversion of the text and html files.\\n\\nIf you are a regular, and have used any of the standard Gutenberg tools like\\n“Gutcheck” or “Jeebies” to find errors, you might mention something like:\\n“Gutcheck finds a lot of bad quotes”.\\n\\nWhen you are able to find the eBook’s title in an online eBook such as “The\\nInternet Archive,” it is a great help to us if you verify your suggested changes\\nand in your report let us know you have done so and the source used.\\n\\nAny errata submissions are freely made, without obligation, and are entirely in\\nthe public domain.\\n\\n * Privacy policy [/policy/privacy_policy.html]\\n * About Project Gutenberg [/about/]\\n * Terms of Use [/policy/terms_of_use.html]\\n * Contact Information [/about/contact_information.html]\\n * Get Help [/help/]\\n\\niBiblio [/gutenberg/ibiblio-logo.png] https://www.ibiblio.org/\"}"}}
