How to Submit Copyright Clearance Materials for Project Gutenberg eBook\\n\\n\\nPROJECT GUTENBERG’S COPYRIGHT RULES\\n\\nWe have seven active rules under which an item may be copyright-cleared for\\ninclusion in the Project Gutenberg collection. If you are uncertain about\\nwhether a rule applies, or whether more than one rule applies, please submit the\\nitem [https://copy.pglaf.org] for our consideration. This is safer and easier\\nthan addressing hypothetical questions about potential items.\\n\\n * Rule 1. Works First Published Before 95 Years Ago and Before 1978\\n * Rule 2. Post-1978 life+70\\n * Rule 3. Post-1978 publication+120\\n * Rule 4. Manuscripts created pre-1978 but published post-1978\\n * Rule 5. Pre-1989 U.S. works without a copyright notice\\n * Rule 6. Pre-1964 U.S. works but timely renewed\\n * Rule 8. Government copyright\\n * Rule 10. Foreign Works\\n\\n(rules 7 and 9 are not currently in use)\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS\\n\\n“Publication” is the distribution of copies or phonorecords of a work to the\\npublic by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending.\\nThe offering to distribute copies or phonorecords to a group of persons for\\npurposes of further distribution, public performance, or public display,\\nconstitutes publication. A public performance or display of a work does not of\\nitself constitute publication. A work is considered to be “first published in\\nthe United States” if it was (i) first published solely in the United States,\\n(ii) first published simultaneously in the United States and another country, or\\n(iii) was also published in the United States within 30 days after first\\npublication in a foreign nation.\\n\\nA “U.S. Work” is a work where (i) one or more of the authors was a national or\\ndomiciliary of the United States at the time of first publication, (ii) the work\\nwas first published in the United States, (iii) the work was first published by\\nthe United Nations or the Organization of American States, (iv) an architectural\\nwork embodied in a building located in the United States, or (v) a pictorial,\\ngraphic, or sculptural work incorporated into a building located in the United\\nStates.\\n\\n\\nRULE 1: WORKS FIRST PUBLISHED BEFORE 95 YEARS AGO AND BEFORE 1978\\n\\nSummary: As of 2023, qualifying Works published in 1928 or earlier do not have\\ncopyright protection in the U.S.\\n\\nDetail: For Works published prior to January 1, 1978, the maximum term of\\ncopyright protection is 95 years from the date of first publication. This is\\nregardless of whether the Work complied with U.S. requirements for notice,\\nregistration and renewal. This is regardless of where the Work was published or\\nthe nationality of the authors.\\n\\nHistorical detail: For Works first published before January 1, 1923, the maximum\\nterm of copyright protection was 75 years from the date of first publication.\\nThis was regardless of whether the Work complied with U.S. requirements for\\nnotice, registration and renewal. This was regardless of where the Work was\\npublished. Thus, any such Works published prior to 1923 have been in the public\\ndomain in the U.S. since 1998 or earlier.\\n\\nRule 1 is the rule we use the most, and it may be utilized for Works published\\nbefore 1978. Works published in 1978 or later are not subject to Rule 1.\\n\\n\\nRULE 2: WORKS FIRST CREATED BY NATURAL PERSONS ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 1978\\n\\nWorks first created on or after January 1, 1978 are protected under U.S.\\ncopyright law until 70 years after the death of the author if the author is a\\nnatural person. (Copyright protection will not expire for any works under this\\nrule until at least January 1, 2049.)\\n\\n\\nRULE 3: WORKS FIRST CREATED BY CORPORATE AUTHORS ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 1978\\n\\nWorks first created on or after January 1, 1978 that are created by a corporate\\nauthor are protected under U.S. copyright law until 95 years after publication\\nor 120 years after creation whichever occurs first. (Copyright protection will\\nnot expire for any works under this rule until at least January 1, 2074.)\\n\\n\\nRULE 4: WORKS FIRST CREATED BEFORE JANUARY 1, 1978 BUT NOT PUBLISHED BEFORE THAT\\nDATE\\n\\nWorks created before January 1, 1978 but not published before that date are\\ncopyrighted under rules similar to rules 2 and 3 above, except that in no case\\nwill the copyright on a work not published prior to January 1, 1978 expire\\nbefore December 31, 2002. If the work was published before December 31, 2002,\\nits copyright will not expire before December 31, 2047. (This rule extends\\ncopyright protection to a lot of manuscripts that we would otherwise think of as\\nnot protected by U.S. copyright law because of their age.)\\n\\n\\nRULE 5: PUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF U.S. WORKS PRIOR TO MARCH 1, 1989\\nWITHOUT PROPER NOTICE\\n\\nIf a substantial number of copies of a U.S. Work were printed and distributed in\\nthe U.S. prior to March 1, 1989 without a copyright notice, and the work is of\\nentirely American authorship or is considered to be first published in the\\nUnited States, the work is not protected under U.S. copyright law. (Note that we\\ncannot clear items printed/published outside of the U.S. under this rule.)\\n\\n\\nRULE 6: FAILURE OF U.S. WORKS TO COMPLY WITH RENEWAL REQUIREMENTS PRIOR TO 1964\\n\\nRule 6 copyright research is only accepted from known volunteers with\\ndemonstrated competency in the required evidence steps to provide non-renewal\\nevidence.\\n\\nPREAMBLE\\n\\nProject Gutenberg’s “Rule 6” from the Copyright How-To provides a mechanism for\\ndemonstrating that items no longer have copyright protection, due to non-renewal\\nof copyright. Rule 6 may only be used for items first published in the US\\nbetween 95 years ago and December 31, 1963.\\n\\nBased on review of the US Library of Congress’ historical renewal records,\\nProject Gutenberg has estimated that over 85% of all registered books and\\nmonographs are never renewed. The procedures described here are intended to\\nidentify whether a particular item is among those that were not renewed.\\n\\nThese procedures are to enact a good faith effort by Project Gutenberg to\\nestablish safe harbor categories of works which clearly are not protected by\\ncopyright due to non-renewal, and whose non-renewal status may be determined\\nunambiguously. These determinations enable PG to move forward and use its\\nresources wisely in its efforts to build its library collection.\\n\\nSCOPE\\n\\nRule 6 may be applied to published books, monographs, serials, or portions of\\nthese items. It may not be applied to unpublished items, such as manuscripts and\\nletters. It may not be applied to other types of items, such as audio recordings\\nor speeches. It may only be applied when first publication was in the US, by\\nauthors residing in the US.\\n\\nIf the work being researched is a play, screenplay or other work intended for\\noral presentation, search must include the Drama section of the renewals for the\\nusual years. Photoplays (usually scripts that have pictures from a production or\\nfilm bound in with them) must be researched in the Film section of the Library\\nof Congress renewal records, as well. Those sections of renewals are not yet\\ndigitized.\\n\\nSUMMARY\\n\\nRule 6 copyright clearances are challenging to complete. Project Gutenberg\\ninsists that that Rule 6 copyright clearance requests are submitted by persons\\nwho have demonstrated their ability to do accurate and complete copyright\\nresearch. Rule 6 clearance research must include three components:\\n\\n 1. Biographical research, to provide details of the nationality of the author,\\n    any pseudonyms, date of death (if applicable), and other information about\\n    the author(s).\\n 2. Bibliographical research, to provide details of when and where the item was\\n    first published, whether it was serialized, whether it was republished under\\n    alternate titles or as part of another collection, and other details on the\\n    publication history of the item.\\n 3. Renewal research, to show that there are no copyright renewals that apply to\\n    the item.\\n\\nPHASE 1: BIOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH\\n\\n * Was the item first published in the United States? If not, Rule 6 cannot be\\n   applied.\\n * Was the author (all authors or other creators such as illustrators) U.S.\\n   residents or citizens at the time of publication? If not, Rule 6 cannot be\\n   applied. A resident, for our purposes, is someone who lives in the U.S. – not\\n   a visitor.\\n * What aliases, variations or pseudonyms did this author use, if any? Include\\n   maiden or married names, if they are different. These need to be searched as\\n   part of the renewal research.\\n * If the author was deceased during the renewal period, what heirs or other\\n   parties might have had the right to renew?\\n\\nPHASE 2: BIBLIOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH\\n\\n * Was the item published under alternate titles, or republished? If so, provide\\n   the alternate titles and republication details. Renewal research needs to\\n   minimally span from 4 years before and after publication, as well as all\\n   possible renewal dates, of the item under investigation. If alternate titles\\n   are found, then renewal research needs to be done for all alternate titles or\\n   alternate publications or dates.\\n * Was the item part of a serial (i.e., in a magazine)? If so, provide the name\\n   of the serial, and research whether the serial was renamed, discontinued, or\\n   otherwise changed. This is because a copyright or renewal on the serial might\\n   have renewed the item.\\n * Was the item published in multiple pieces (i.e., published serially, in\\n   parts)? If so, this extends the time span of possibly valid renewals.\\n * Was the item later republished as part of a collection, such as in a book of\\n   collected stories? If it was republished within 4 years, then the collection\\n   renewal might apply to the original.\\n\\nNote that there are many resources for this bibliographical research, and none\\nare complete. Different genres and time periods are covered by different\\nresources (print and online). Submitters must have the needed expertise to know\\nwhat resources are available and suitable for the necessary research.\\n\\nPHASE 3: RENEWAL RESEARCH\\n\\nIf the Catalog of Copyright Entries is available for the initial publication, an\\neffort should be made to find the initial registration as it may provide\\nvaluable additional information in determining whether the item has been\\nrenewed.\\n\\nSearch for renewal records. Provide details on which resources (print or online)\\nwere used. Search for all variations on title, author, compilation, etc. Provide\\ndetails on search terms used and other variations.\\n\\nSITUATIONS THAT PREVENT A DETERMINATION OF NOT HAVING COPYRIGHT PROTECTION UNDER\\nRULE 6\\n\\nRenewals that would be due on the 28th year after first publication could\\nactually occur or be registered earlier or later. For this reason, we consider\\nan otherwise valid renewal to be applicable if it is found in the 27th, 28th,\\n29th or 30th year after first publication. Thus, renewals need to be searched\\nplus or minus two years of the 28th year after first publication.\\n\\nIf a variation is found to be renewed for the 28th year after publication (plus\\nor minus 2 years), then Project Gutenberg will not assert that the item no\\nlonger has copyright protection. Variations include very similar items (such as\\nreprints).\\n\\nFor serial items, renewals for the entire work (with all serial parts combined)\\nwill be deemed to apply to each serial part. However, this only applies when the\\nitem and/or the renewal are within the four year period (27th, 28th, 29th and\\n30th year after first publication).\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n * An item was published in serial parts from 1930-1931, then published as an\\n   entire work within two years after any serial part. In that case, any valid\\n   renewal of a serial part or of the entire work will be deemed to apply to all\\n   serial parts and the entire work.\\n * An item was published in serial parts from 1930-1931, then published as an\\n   entire work more than two years after any serial part (i.e., after 1931+2, or\\n   from 1934 onwards). In that case, any renewals for the entire work will not\\n   apply to any serial part, even when the serial parts are combined by Project\\n   Gutenberg or others.\\n\\nRenewal by someone other than the author may occur for a variety of reasons.\\nProject Gutenberg does not have the resources to investigate whether a renewal\\nmight be invalid due to who renews. Thus, any renewal within the allowed time\\nperiod is treated by Project Gutenberg as valid.\\n\\nTIME SPAN FOR RENEWAL RECORDS\\n\\n * Too late for a valid renewal: Items became eligible for renewal 28 years\\n   after the original publication. Because of the flexibility in renewal dates\\n   allowed by the US Copyright Office, and because publication of renewals might\\n   not happen in a timely fashion, Project Gutenberg seeks to identify renewals\\n   from plus or minus 2 years from the 28th year after the publication date.\\n * Too late for serial parts: If a complete work was reprinted, and the reprint\\n   was renewed more than 30 years after the original (28+2), then the renewal\\n   does not apply to the original.\\n\\nWHAT TO SUBMIT\\n\\nDocumentation of your research must accompany a Rule 6 clearance request, as\\nsubmitted at copy.pglaf.org. Include your responses as an additional .txt file\\nwith the clearance data.\\n\\nBasic Information\\n\\n * The original title, original publication date, and author(s) name. Include a\\n   scan of the title page, verso page, and other pages as appropriate from the\\n   original publication\\n * Original copyright registration record identifier, if known\\n\\nBiographical information\\n\\n * Any known variations on the author’s name, including pseudonyms. What sources\\n   did you use?\\n * Was the author (all authors) a U.S. citizen and resident at the time of\\n   publication? What sources did you use?\\n * Author(s) birth date, and death date if deceased. What sources did you use?\\n * If the author is deceased, information about heirs or others to whom renewal\\n   rights might have been assigned. What sources did you use?\\n\\nBibliographical information\\n\\n * Provide any alternate titles or subtitles.\\n * Was this a serialized item (that is, was it published in parts, such as in a\\n   magazine)? If so, provide details on when the other serial parts appeared.\\n * Was the item republished (reprinted, re-released, etc.)? If so, provide\\n   bibliographic citations and other details on known republications.\\n * If the item was republished, how closely do the republications match the\\n   original? Look at the first page of each chapter or section, noting all\\n   differences. Look for passages that are present in one version, but absent in\\n   another. Report these differences.\\n * If the item was republished, provide any alternate titles or subtitles.\\n\\nRenewal research\\n\\n * Search for renewal records for all variations of the title, subtitle, and\\n   author(s), including for any known republications (even if they were\\n   published more than 4 years after the originals). See below for some of the\\n   eligible renewal resources. Report all records found, and the source you\\n   obtained them from.\\n * If part of a serial, include a search for renewal records for the serial\\n   issues from four years before and after publication of any serial part of the\\n   work.\\n * If part of a compilation or other collected work, include a search for\\n   renewal records for the collection. Search under the collection editor\\n   name(s), as well as the collection title and any variations.- If any renewals\\n   have limitations (notably, limitations that the copyright applies to the\\n   compilation or serial or editorial matter, not the work or works they\\n   include), provide details. For all renewal research, list the specific\\n   resources utilized.\\n\\nALTERNATE METHODOLOGY\\n\\nA letter from the publisher, written statements from the author or heirs, or\\ncourt cases are examples of evidence for copyright protection status that, if\\navailable, may supersede the other research. Such evidence might confirm or deny\\ncopyright protection status.\\n\\nIf these types of data are available, please discuss with the Project Gutenberg\\ncopyright clearance team to determine how to proceed.\\n\\nRENEWAL RESOURCES\\n\\nConsult the Copyright Renewal Registers to look for a renewal record. There are\\nseveral sources, so you often need to look in more than one place. These\\nRegisters are published annually, and are partially online via the US Copyright\\nOffice. Project Gutenberg has digitized a number of volumes, and there are\\nsearchable databases at Stanford and Rutgers.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg has published eBooks of all of the Book entries from the\\nCopyright Renewal Register as eBooks # 11800 (all volumes combined) through\\n11856. These are not exhaustive for all entry types, since periodicals were only\\nsometimes included in the source publications.\\n\\nA more complete set of data is here: onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/cce,\\nincluding page scans of the same materials as the Project Gutenberg eBooks\\n#11800 - 11856 (good for checking for possible typos in the eBooks), as well as\\nthe Periodicals sections not included in the PG eBooks. This site also includes\\ndrama and artwork renewals 1950-1952, and all other nonmusical renewals for\\n1950.\\n\\nFor renewal records 1978 through 1992, you must also search at the US Library of\\nCongress Web site: www.copyright.gov/records\\n\\nTo summarize, PG #11800 has (non-drama) book renewals for 1950-1977, periodicals\\nrenewals for 1950 only, and contributions to periodicals renewals for mid-1953\\nthrough 1977. (It also has all other nonmusical renewals for 1950.) Thus, #11800\\ncannot be the only source used for anything published in a periodical prior to\\n1955, nor for anything published after 1947 (items that needed to be renewed by\\n1975). Additionally, it can only be used for books and (some) periodicals, not\\nfor other types of works (drama, artwork, music…).\\n\\nMost recent update: August 21, 2016 (with minor typographical changes on January\\n13, 2019).\\n\\n\\nRULE 8: U.S. GOVERNMENT WORKS\\n\\nItems published by the United States Government do not have copyright protection\\nin the US. We need to be careful with this rule, because some items distributed\\nby the U.S. Government might have been authored by other entities who are\\nentitled to a copyright.\\n\\n\\nRULE 10: PROTECTION OF FOREIGN WORKS IN THE U.S. UNDER U.S. COPYRIGHT LAW\\n\\nPREAMBLE\\n\\nThe key concept for protection of published foreign works under U.S. copyright\\nlaw is to grant copyright protection in the U.S. under U.S. law, equivalent to\\nthat afforded to U.S. Works created and first published at a similar time, to\\nworks of foreign countries who grant reciprocity to U.S. works in their\\nterritories under their copyright laws. The countries whose works qualify for\\nthis protection are called Treaty Parties or Proclamation Countries. Because of\\nthis equivalency principle, many of the rules for foreign works will seem\\nsimilar to rules for U.S. Works. However, different research is required because\\nit is first necessary to determine i) what were the authors’ nationalities and\\ndomiciles at the time of first publication, ii) what is the work’s source\\ncountry, and iii) whether the work’s source country currently qualifies as a\\nTreaty Party or a Proclamation Country. Research into publication with or\\nwithout notice or into registration or renewal is not necessary because foreign\\nworks from Treaty Parties and Proclamation Countries are no longer required to\\ncomply with U.S. formalities including notice, registration, and renewal. The\\nremainder of the maximum term of protection under U.S. law has been restored for\\nall works of Treaty Parties and Proclamation Countries which previously may have\\nlost copyright protection under U.S. law for failure to comply with notice,\\nregistration and renewal requirements.\\n\\nADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS FOR FOREIGN WORKS\\n\\nA “Treaty Party” is a country or intergovernmental organization other than the\\nUnited States that is a party to 1. the Universal Copyright Convention; 2. the\\nGeneva Phonograms Convention, which is the Convention for the Protection of\\nProducers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of Their Phonograms,\\nconcluded at Geneva, Switzerland, on October 29, 1971; 3. the Berne Convention,\\nwhich is the Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works,\\nsigned at Berne, Switzerland, on September 9, 1886, and all acts, protocols, and\\nrevisions thereto ; 4. the WTO (World Trade Organization) Agreement; 5. the WIPO\\nCopyright Treaty concluded at Geneva, Switzerland, on December 20, 1996; 6. the\\nWIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty concluded at Geneva, Switzerland, on\\nDecember 20, 1996.; and any other copyright treaty to which the United States is\\na party.\\n\\nA “Presidential Proclamation Country” is a country for which a presidential\\nproclamation has been issued finding that the particular foreign nation extends,\\nto works by authors who are nationals or domiciliaries of the United States or\\nto works that are first published in the United States, copyright protection on\\nsubstantially the same basis as that on which the foreign nation extends\\nprotection to works of its own nationals and domiciliaries and works first\\npublished in that nation.\\n\\nThe “Source Country” for a published work is a Treaty Party or Presidential\\nProclamation country 1. in which the work is first published, or 2. if the work\\nis published on the same day in 2 or more eligible countries, the eligible\\ncountry which has the most significant contacts with the work.\\n\\nAn “eligible foreign work” is a published work satisfying one or more of the\\nfollowing criteria: 1. on the date of first publication, one or more of the\\nauthors is a national, domiciliary, or sovereign authority of a treaty party, or\\nis a stateless person; or 2. the work is first published in a foreign nation\\nthat, on the date of first publication, is a treaty party; or 3. the work is a\\nsound recording that was first fixed in a treaty party; or 4. the work is a\\npictorial, graphic, or sculptural work that is incorporated in a building or\\nother structure, or an architectural work that is embodied in a building and the\\nbuilding or structure is located in a treaty party; or 5. the work comes within\\nthe scope of a Presidential proclamation extending U.S. copyright protection to\\nworks of which one or more of the authors is, on the date of first publication,\\na national, domiciliary, or sovereign authority of that nation, or which was\\nfirst published in that nation.\\n\\nRULE 10(A) - UNPUBLISHED WORKS OF FOREIGN AUTHORS\\n\\nU.S. law grants exactly the same protection to unpublished works created by\\nforeign authors as it grants to unpublished works created by U.S. authors\\nregardless of the nationality of any foreign authors or the treaty status of the\\nauthors’ countries of nationality or domicile. Apply Rules 2, 3 and 4.\\n\\nRULE 10(B) - WORKS OF TREATY PARTIES AND PROCLAMATION COUNTRIES FIRST PUBLISHED\\nBEFORE 1923\\n\\nThe maximum term of protection under U.S. copyright law for eligible foreign\\nworks first published before January 1, 1923 expired no more than 75 years from\\nthe date of first publication. Hence, all works which would otherwise qualify as\\neligible foreign works first published before 1923 are no longer protected by\\nU.S. copyright law, regardless of where they were published.\\n\\nRULE 10(C) - WORKS OF TREATY PARTIES AND PROCLAMATION COUNTRIES FIRST PUBLISHED\\nBETWEEN 1923 AND 1978\\n\\nThe maximum term of copyright protection for eligible foreign works first\\npublished between 1923-1978 expires 95 years from the date of first publication.\\n2019 was the first year in which works could be cleared under this rule.\\n\\nRULE 10(D) - WORKS OF TREATY PARTIES AND PROCLAMATION COUNTRIES FIRST PUBLISHED\\nON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 1978\\n\\n 1. Eligible foreign work first created by authors who are natural persons on or\\n    after January 1, 1978 are protected under U.S. copyright law until 70 years\\n    after the death of the author. ( Copyright protection will not expire for\\n    any works under this rule until at least January 1, 2049.).\\n 2. Eligible foreign works first created on or after January 1, 1978 by a\\n    corporate author are protected under U.S. copyright law until 95 years after\\n    publication or 120 years after creation whichever occurs first. (Copyright\\n    protection will not expire for any works under this rule until at least\\n    January 1, 2074.)\\n 3. Eligible foreign works created before January 1, 1978 but not published\\n    before that date are protected under U.S. copyright law under rules similar\\n    to (1) and (2) above, except that in no case will the copyright on a work\\n    not published prior to January 1, 1978 expire before December 31, 2002. If\\n    the work is published before December 31, 2002, its copyright will not\\n    expire before December 31, 2047. (This rule extends copyright protection to\\n    a lot of manuscripts that we would otherwise think of as not protected by\\n    U.S. copyright law because of their age.)\\n\\nRULE 10(E) - PUBLISHED WORKS FROM COUNTRIES WHO DO NOT QUALIFY AS TREATY PARTIES\\nOR PROCLAMATION COUNTRIES\\n\\nIf the source country for a work is not the United States or a Treaty Party\\ncountry or a Presidential Proclamation country, then the work has no protection\\nin the United States under U.S. copyright law. Very few countries fit in this\\ncategory.\\n\\nTHOSE ARE ALL THE RULES WE USE. PLEASE CONTACT US BEFORE DECIDING THAT A RULE\\nAPPLIES TO A WORK YOU ARE INTERESTED IN, AS WE NEED TO HAVE THE FINAL DECISION.\\nDUE TO THE RISKS OF COPYRIGHT VIOLATION, WE MUST PERFORM \\\"DUE DILIGENCE\\\" TO MAKE\\nSURE THAT WE HAVE RIGHTS TO USE THE ITEMS WE DISTRIBUTE.\\n\\nNOTE THAT PROJECT GUTENBERG COPYRIGHT RESEARCH IS ONLY FOR PROJECT GUTENBERG,\\nAND ONLY FOR PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING COPYRIGHT UNDER UNITED STATES LAWS. WE\\nCANNOT PERFORM RESEARCH FOR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WOULD\\nBE WISE TO SEEK THEIR OWN LEGAL GUIDANCE FOR COPYRIGHT ISSUES.\\n\\n\\nMORE COPYRIGHT LAW\\n\\nBelow is a little more background and detail on U.S. copyright law as it\\npertains to Project Gutenberg:\\n\\nCaveat: Each edition of a work may have its own period of copyright protection\\n(this depends on whether the new edition involves “authorship” or simply\\ncorrects punctuation). Every translation has independent copyright protection. A\\nnew edition does not extend the protection of the original edition.\\n\\n\\nCOPYRIGHT RULES FOR OTHER COUNTRIES\\n\\nThe general rule for the minimum term of copyright protection is life of the\\nauthor plus 50 years (extended to life plus 70 years in many countries, as a\\nresult of globalization of copyright laws and pressure from content owners). No\\nmajor country other than the United States has required copyright notice, and\\nrefused protection for works without copyright notice. Rules on corporate\\nauthors differ.\\n\\n\\nWHOSE LAW APPLIES?\\n\\nWhen someone publishes or distributes in the United States, U.S. law applies.\\nWhen someone publishes or distributes in other countries, their law applies.\\n\\n\\nWHAT CHANGES HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE TERM OF COPYRIGHT PROTECTION IN THE UNITED\\nSTATES?\\n\\nUnder the 1909 Copyright Act, the original term lasted 28 years (not 26). It was\\nrenewable for an extra 28 years, for a total of 56 years. Until 1992, copyright\\nprotection would expire if renewal was not filed in a timely manner. However,\\neven with diligent research, it is difficult to determine with assurance that\\nrenewal was not filed.\\n\\nIn the mid 1950’s Congress started working on a major revision of the copyright\\nact, but by 1960 it was clear that this would not be a short process. By 1962,\\nthe copyright had expired on everything published before 1906. It was clear that\\nthe new act would grant existing works a total term of 75 years. To prevent\\nthese works from losing out on the 75 year extension while Congress worked out\\nall the other details of the new act, Congress started passing extension acts in\\n1962. Such extensions prevented copyright expirations before the passage of the\\n1976 Copyright Act, with the result that all copyrights in existence in 1962\\nwere extended to at least 1976 when the 75-year term kicked in.\\n\\nEffective in 1998, after copyright protection for works first published in 1922\\nhad expired, the copyright term was extended for all works as to which copyright\\nprotection had not yet expired. Thus, for works published in 95+ years ago, and\\nthereafter (provided they were renewed, or were exempt from renewal\\nrequirements) the effective term will be 95 years.\\n\\nThe rules on public speeches, musical performances, and other works not\\noriginally fixed in a tangible medium of expression are somewhat different, and\\nrequire a determination based on the facts of the individual instance.\\n\\n\\nHOW TO SUBMIT COPYRIGHT CLEARANCE MATERIALS FOR PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK\\n\\nVisit this page to upload page scans from the title page and verso page for the\\nbook you have:\\n\\n * https://copy.pglaf.org [https://copy.pglaf.org]\\n\\nThe page includes instructions and links to upload, and your submission will get\\na response within a few weeks.
