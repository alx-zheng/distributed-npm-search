Like most important\\ninnovations and social changes, the printing press was an evolution that had\\ndeep roots in history.\\n\\nMove forward in time to 1971, when Michael Hart invented the eBook. Like\\nGutenberg’s printing press, Hart’s innovation followed decades of prior work. To\\nname a few, this includes Vannevar Bush’s “Memex” (1930s, based on microfiche),\\nBob Brown’s “The Readies” (1930s), Brown University’s “FRESS” (1960s), Ted\\nNelson’s Xanadu (1960s), and many others.\\n\\nWhat Michael envisioned in 1971 was eBooks for reading enjoyment. This was the\\ninnovation. His focus was not on the mechanics of presentation or analysis, nor\\nwas it on outcomes like literary analysis or hermeneutics. The eBook as Michael\\nenvisioned it would have a similar purpose to the printed book: enjoyable to\\nread, and a source of enlightenment, education, and entertainment. It would all\\nbe free, for unlimited reuse and without limitation of purpose.\\n\\nFor the two decades from 1971-1991, Hart evangelized the idea of eBooks, and\\nworked on the first 100 or so titles. These included historical documents -\\nfamously starting with the US Declaration of Independence. Also reference works,\\nliterary works, a few donated contemporary works, mathematical constants, and\\nmore. Subsequent years saw issuance of short videos and longer movies, graphical\\ncollections, sheet music, audio files, and eBooks in dozens of languages and\\nformats.\\n\\nLike the movable type printing press, the modern digital computer was a machine\\nusable for many different purposes: all types of content, suitable for a wide\\nrange of interests. This inspired the vision and genius of Michael Hart.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg evolved from a concept to become an organization. Volunteers\\nwould identity printed books to digitize, and create an eBook for Project\\nGutenberg to publish and redistribute.\\n\\nBy the turn of the new millennium, Project Gutenberg was producing thousands of\\nnew eBooks per year. Distributed Proofreaders was launched, and became the\\nbiggest single source of new eBooks - harnessing the combined energies of\\nvolunteers.\\n\\nDigital eBook readers became commonplace, and by the second decade of the\\nmillennium it was clear that eBooks had become widely adopted. Over the course\\nof more than 30 years, the concept of literature being available for unlimited\\nredistribution, freely available to all for any purpose, had gone from being\\nseen as rather outlandish to becoming completely mainstream. This is the pathway\\nof successful innovations, and in the case of Project Gutenberg the innovation\\nhas boundless social benefits.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg has kept up with the times, offering e-reader friendly formats\\nand features to help get free literature to as many people as possible - whether\\nthey are using a computer, a tablet, an e-reader, a mobile phone, or even if\\nthey are printing the eBooks on paper.\\n\\nEveryone should have free, unlimited access to the world’s literature. Whenever\\nthey want, with a variety of formatting and delivery choices. “Literature,” said\\nHart, “should be as free as the air we breathe.”\\n\\nOn the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Michael Hart’s invention, Project\\nGutenberg remains vibrant and relevant. The efforts of thousands of volunteers\\nhave created a library of literature, reference and more, with over 60 languages\\nand dialects.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg celebrates 50 years of eBooks, and of continuously improving\\nmethods for creating and distributing them. The enduring gift of literary works\\nto the people of the world is the outcome of the spirit of innovation and\\ndevotion to the common good.\\n\\nEnjoy these eBooks. Share them. Celebrate.\\n\\n\\nANYONE CAN HELP MAKE NEW EBOOKS!\\n\\nProject Gutenberg was built by volunteers, and all new eBooks are the result of\\nvolunteer effort. The best way to help is to join Distributed Proofreaders\\n[https://www.pgdp.net]. DP includes supportive forums for discussion, an online\\ntutorial, and a variety of roles to suit different skills and interests. DP\\nproduces eBooks in many different languages.\\n\\n\\nREAD MORE ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG\\n\\n * Michael Stern Hart (1947-2011) [https://www.gutenberg.org/attic/hart.html]\\n   including an eulogy, timeline, and external links (2011).\\n\\n * The History and Philosophy of Project Gutenberg by Michael Hart\\n   [/about/background/history_and_philosophy.html] (1992)\\n\\n * Project Gutenberg eBooks by Marie Lebert covering the history of Project\\n   Gutenberg:\\n   * in English (2008): Project Gutenberg (1971-2008)\\n     [https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27045].\\n   * in French (2008): Le Projet Gutenberg (1971-2008)\\n     [https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27046].\\n   * in Spanish (2009): El Proyecto Gutenberg (1971-2009)\\n     [https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31633].\\n   * album with pictures (PDF) for Project Gutenberg’s 40th anniversary: Project\\n     Gutenberg 4 July 1971 - 4 July 2011\\n     [https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36616].\\n\\n * Project Gutenberg eBook: Forty-Five Years of Digitizing Ebooks: Project\\n   Gutenberg’s Practices [https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60600] by Greg Newby,\\n   describing how eBooks are selected and digitized (2019).\\n\\n * Project Gutenberg web page: Collection Development Policy\\n   [https://www.gutenberg.org/policy/collection_development.html], which\\n   describes what is currently being added to the collection, and why.
