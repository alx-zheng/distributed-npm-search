This How-To contains some of\\nthe basics to get started in creating an eBook for submission to Project\\nGutenberg.\\n\\nContents\\n 1. What types of eBooks may be submitted to Project Gutenberg?\\n 2. Who should submit an eBook?\\n 3. Copyright\\n 4. File Formats\\n 5. Creating an eBook\\n\\n\\nWHAT TYPES OF EBOOKS MAY BE SUBMITTED TO PROJECT GUTENBERG?\\n\\nProject Gutenberg only accepts works that are in the public domain in the United\\nStates. Generally, new submissions to Project Gutenberg are digitized versions\\nof printed books, most of which were published at least 95 years ago (see the\\nCopyright How-To for details). Confirmation of public domain status is via the\\ncopy.pglaf.org [https://copy.pglaf.org] site.\\n\\nCollection development focuses on literature and other written works that have\\nenduring value for readers. Selections are made by volunteers with diverse\\ninterests, and essentially all eligible submissions are welcome.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg does not avoid difficult or unpopular topics, or topics for\\nwhich societal views, or state-of-the-art knowledge, is vastly different from\\ncontemporary literature.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg does not accept copyrighted or other contemporary items, even\\nif copyright or licensing permission would be granted (this includes the various\\n“open” licenses). Instead, see the self-publishing portal described in the\\nSubmitting Your own Work How-To. In the past, a greater variety of non-public\\ndomain and non-literary works was added to Project Gutenberg, including\\ncopyrighted & other donated works, non-print formats, and different encodings\\nand file types. Today, there are many outlets for such other items, and Project\\nGutenberg is entirely focused on works in the public domain. This includes\\nliterature, reference works, and variations such as children’s books and\\ntravelogues.\\n\\n\\nWHO SHOULD SUBMIT AN EBOOK?\\n\\nCreating an eBook is a lot of work, and Project Gutenberg’s requirements are\\nrather strict. If these steps seem daunting, you might be better off working\\nwith Distributed Proofreaders [https://www.pgdp.net], where every volunteer\\ncontributes to a portion of the effort. Distributed Proofreaders has its own\\nguidelines on submissions\\n[https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Official_Documentation:General/New_Volunteer_Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_we_pick_the_books_that_we_do.3F],\\nas well as other policy, guidance, and community.\\n\\nBeing a “solo” producer involves obtaining copyright, then scanning or\\nharvesting to obtain images of a book’s pages, then engaging in many hours of\\nproofreading and formatting, and, finally, ensuring the eBook is fully valid\\nHTML, correctly spelled, and otherwise compliant with Project Gutenberg’s\\nrequirements. The detailed requirements are on the submission page\\n[https://upload.pglaf.org], which also includes tools for automatically checking\\ncompliance. Any new submitter is invited to get in touch before to getting\\nstarted. Contact the “copyright” or “whitewashers” team &emdash; email addresses\\nare at the bottom of the copyright [https://copy.pglaf.org] and upload\\n[https://upload.pglaf.org] sites.\\n\\n\\nCOPYRIGHT\\n\\nThe first step in any eBook submission is to confirm that Project Gutenberg may\\nlegally distribute the eBook. Visit our Copyright How-To [/help/copyright.html]\\nfor details. Project Gutenberg will not accept any eBook without confirming\\ncopyright status. Generally, this means that a printed book has entered the\\npublic domain in the United States, typically because copyright has expired.\\n\\n\\nFILE FORMATS\\n\\nThe master format for nearly all new Project Gutenberg eBooks is HTML. Project\\nGutenberg insists the HTML is fully valid, and any cascading style sheets (CSS)\\nin the HTML are part of the published standards by the World Wide Web consortium\\n(W3C).\\n\\nWhenever possible, Project Gutenberg also requires a plain text version of an\\neBook. We stress the inclusion of plain text because of its longevity: Project\\nGutenberg includes numerous text files that are over 30 years old. In that time,\\ndozens of widely used file formats have come and gone. Text is accessible on all\\ncomputers, and is also insurance against future obsolescence.\\n\\nThe only times when Project Gutenberg distributes an eBook without a plain text\\nversion are when plain text is impossible or impractical — for example, for our\\nmovies and MP3 audio files, and for some of our mathematical works.\\n\\nThis isn’t as hard as it sounds, if you start with HTML, and continuously\\nconfirm validity using the W3C’s online validator (see the upload page\\n[https://upload.pglaf.org] for details). Modern eBook producers almost always\\nstart with (valid) HTML, and then derive plain text from the HTML. These two\\n“master” formats, text and HTML, are then submitted to Project Gutenberg.\\nAutomated tools then create derivative formats, including epub and mobi (the\\ncommon e-reader formats).\\n\\nHand-crafted epub and mobi files are not accepted, currently. This limitation is\\nmainly to allow easy editing when fixes are applied, because application of\\nfixes occurs many times over the lifetime of every eBook. Project Gutenberg\\ntries to limit the number of master formats, and then automate derived formats,\\nto facilitate continuous improvement of items in the collection.\\n\\nA small number of new eBooks utilize LaTeX or TEI as the master format - mostly\\nthose including lots of mathematical notation. Other less frequently utilized\\nformats include ReSstructured Text (RST), Rich Data Format (RDF), and a few\\nothers. Note that PDF, Word, and other word processor formats are not utilized\\nas master formats, because they do not convert easily to valid HTML. In\\naddition, they are much more challenging to fix/update than HTML and plain text.\\n\\n\\nCREATING AN EBOOK\\n\\nThe Volunteer’s FAQ [/help/volunteers_faq.html] has extensive guidance on best\\npractices for Project Gutenberg eBooks. Some of this information is outdated,\\nand the focus is on solo eBook producers. Get in touch, if you need additional\\nguidance.\\n\\nTurning a physical book into an eBook is a wonderful way to preserve the book,\\nand to make it more widely available. Historically, eBook creation was usually\\nby a single person typing in the physical book, a page at a time. This technique\\nstill works, of course, and is sometimes necessary (for example, if the book is\\ndamaged or extremely fragile).\\n\\n * Privacy policy [/policy/privacy_policy.html]\\n * About Project Gutenberg [/about/]\\n * Terms of Use [/policy/terms_of_use.html]\\n * Contact Information [/about/contact_information.html]\\n * Get Help [/help/]\\n\\niBiblio [/gutenberg/ibiblio-logo.png] https://www.ibiblio.org/\"}"}}
