By dividing the workload into individual\\npages, many volunteers can work on a book at the same time, which significantly\\nspeeds up the creation process.\\n\\nDuring proofreading, volunteers are presented with a scanned page image and the\\ncorresponding OCR text on a single web page. This allows the text to be easily\\ncompared to the image, proofread, and sent back to the site. A second volunteer\\nis then presented with the first volunteer's work and the same page image,\\nverifies and corrects the work as necessary, and submits it back to the site.\\nThe book then similarly progresses through a third proofreading round and two\\nformatting rounds using the same web interface.\\n\\nOnce all the pages have completed these steps, a post-processor carefully\\nassembles them into an e-book, optionally makes it available to interested\\nparties for 'smooth reading', and submits it to the Project Gutenberg\\n[https://www.gutenberg.org] archive.\\n\\n\\nHOW YOU CAN HELP\\n\\n * Register [https://www.pgdp.net/c/accounts/addproofer.php] with the site as a\\n   volunteer\\n   and/or\\n * Donate [http://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DPFoundation:Information_for_Donors] to the\\n   Distributed Proofreaders Foundation.\\n\\nRegistered volunteers may contribute to Distributed Proofreaders in several ways\\nincluding proofreading, \\\"smooth reading\\\" pre-released e-books to check for\\nerrors, managing projects, providing content, or even helping develop\\nimprovements to the site. Volunteers may also join other members of our\\ncommunity in our forums to discuss these and many other topics.\\n\\n\\nVOLUNTEERING AT DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS\\n\\nIt's easy to volunteer at Distributed Proofreaders. Simply register as a\\nvolunteer [https://www.pgdp.net/c/accounts/addproofer.php]. Once you've\\nconfirmed your registration by e-mail, you'll receive an introductory e-mail\\nwith basic instructions on how to log in and use the site. Then, you're ready to\\nsign in and start learning to proofread or visit the smooth reading page to pick\\nan e-book to read! Wherever you go, you'll find lots of information to help you\\nget started. Please try our Walkthrough [https://www.pgdp.net/d/walkthrough/en]\\nfor a preview of the steps involved when proofreading on this site.\\n\\nThere is no commitment expected on this site beyond the understanding that you\\ndo your best. Spend as much or as little time as you like. We encourage you to\\nproofread at least a page a day and/or smooth read a book as often as your time\\nallows, but it's entirely up to you.\\n\\nWe hope you will join us in our mission of \\\"preserving the literary history of\\nthe world in a freely available form for everyone to use.\\\"\\n\\nWe are unable to provide certification for any purpose that would require\\nDistributed Proofreaders to track the number of hours spent volunteering, or to\\nprovide verification of a user's identity beyond that provided by their email\\naddress, or to certify that the volunteer personally performed the work. For\\nthese reasons, we cannot provide certification for court-ordered community\\nservice, programs operated by federal, state, or municipal governments, etc. For\\nmore information, please see this page\\n[https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Official_Documentation:General/Certification_of_Volunteer_Work].\\n\\n\\nCURRENT PROGRESS\\n\\n★\\n47,628 in Completed [list_etexts.php?x=g&sort=5]\\n[XML]\\n[https://www.pgdp.net/c/graphics/xml.gif]https://www.pgdp.net/c/feeds/backend.php?content=posted\\n[RSS]\\n[https://www.pgdp.net/c/graphics/rss.gif]https://www.pgdp.net/c/feeds/backend.php?content=posted&type=rss\\n\\nThese books have been processed through our site and posted to the Project\\nGutenberg archive.\\n\\n★\\n1,878 In Progress [list_etexts.php?x=s&sort=5]\\n[XML]\\n[https://www.pgdp.net/c/graphics/xml.gif]https://www.pgdp.net/c/feeds/backend.php?content=postprocessing\\n[RSS]\\n[https://www.pgdp.net/c/graphics/rss.gif]https://www.pgdp.net/c/feeds/backend.php?content=postprocessing&type=rss\\n\\nThese books are undergoing their final checks before being assembled into a\\ncompleted e-book.\\n\\n★\\n594 in Proofreading [list_etexts.php?x=b&sort=5]\\n[XML]\\n[https://www.pgdp.net/c/graphics/xml.gif]https://www.pgdp.net/c/feeds/backend.php?content=proofing\\n[RSS]\\n[https://www.pgdp.net/c/graphics/rss.gif]https://www.pgdp.net/c/feeds/backend.php?content=proofing&type=rss\\n\\nThese books are currently being processed through our site; sign in and start\\nhelping!\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur community of proofreaders, project managers, developers, etc. is composed\\nentirely of volunteers.\\n425 active users in the past twenty-four hours.\\n797 active users in the past 7 days.\\n1,462 active users in the past 30 days.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nQuestions or comments?
