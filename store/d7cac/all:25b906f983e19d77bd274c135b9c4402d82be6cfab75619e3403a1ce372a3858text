Your donations make it possible to support these\\nvolunteers, and pay our expenses to continue the creation of free electronic\\ntexts.\\n\\nDonations are made to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\n[/about/pglaf.html], a non-profit corporation registered in the US State of\\nMississippi. PGLAF is approved as a charitable 501(c)(3) organization by the US\\nInternal Revenue Service, and has the Federal Employee Information Number (EIN)\\n64-6221541.\\n\\nThere are several ways to donate. We want you to make a donation in the best way\\nfor you, so have tried to make it easy.\\n\\nIn summary, BuyMeACoffee or PayPal are usually the easiest and most flexible\\npayment methods. We can also accept mailed checks or money orders in any\\nnational currency, and a few other methods. If you want to make a donation in a\\nway that’s not specified below, please contact us! PGLAF has participated in\\nsome employee matching programs, Benevity, and others.\\n\\n\\nABOUT DONATIONS BY BUYMEACOFFEE\\n\\nBuyMeACoffee (or Buy Me A Coffee) is a website for donations that provides 100%\\nof all donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. It\\nrequires no registration for donors.\\n\\nYou can donate in any increment of $5. Five American dollars is envisioned as\\nthe nominal cost of a (rather fancy) cup of coffee. You can learn more about\\nthis donation platform on their FAQ page [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/faq].\\n\\nProject Gutenberg is provided with your name and the donation amount, but is not\\nprovided your contact information (email, Twitter, or any other identification\\nthat you might have submitted. So, we cannot send a “thank you” note.\\n\\nIf you need a tax receipt, be sure to save the payment information from the Buy\\nMe A Coffee website.\\n\\n\\nABOUT DONATIONS BY PAYPAL\\n\\nPayPal is a Web site that accepts credit cards, checks, and bank transfer\\npayments. You need to set up a PayPal account to donate via PayPal (in the past,\\nyou could donate without setting up an account. This doesn’t seem to be possible\\nany more). Visa, MasterCard, Amex and Discover are accepted. Because of PayPal’s\\nfees, any donation of under 32 cents or so doesn’t reach PGLAF. Instead,\\nconsider letting your small donations add up to a dollar or more before sending\\nit with PayPal.\\n\\nIn addition to using the quick donation links above, you can also login to\\nPayPal and select “Send Money.” When prompted, specify ‘donate2024@pglaf.org’ as\\nthe recipient, and you will be presented with PGLAF’s information. Send the\\npayment as you would any other payment. Funds go directly to PGLAF via PayPal.\\nAny national currency is OK.\\n\\nBe assured that you will not be added to any postal or email list or solicited\\nfurther. You will get a “thank you” email from the CEO, and that is all. You are\\ninvited to subscribe to the email lists, but we do not subscribe you directly.\\n\\nThis emailed thank you and your PayPal transaction record serve as your tax\\nreceipt for your donation.\\n\\nThe fee charged by PayPal for your donation is their discounted rate for\\nregistered charities. This is 2.2% of the transaction plus 30 cents per\\ntransaction. For a $100 payment, this amounts to $2.50 or 2.5%. For $10, the fee\\nis $0.52 or 5.2%. PayPal accepts non-US accounts and funds.\\n\\n\\nABOUT DONATING BY CHECK OR MONEY ORDER\\n\\nSend a check or money order in US funds. Our address is:\\n\\nProject Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nPO Box 16327\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116\\n\\nThe bank we utilize, Wells Fargo, does not charge any fees for our use of the\\nbank account. They do charge a fee of at least $5 for depositing checks from\\noutside the US or in non-US currency. Any donation of $100 or over will receive\\na written “thank you” via postal mail, unless you do not provide a return\\naddress.\\n\\nThis written thank you and your cancelled check serve as your tax receipt for\\nyour donation.\\n\\n\\nABOUT DONATING BY NON-US FUNDS CHECK OR MONEY ORDER\\n\\nSend a check or money order in non-US funds. This can go to the same address as\\nabove. The bank charges a fee for processing non-US funds. This fee is difficult\\nto know in advance, but usually seems to be five dollars or slightly more for\\nchecks of at least $USD 100 in value. The exchange rate to US funds is at market\\nvalue.\\n\\n\\nPRIVACY POLICY FOR DONATIONS\\n\\nIn order to meet IRS tax regulations, PGLAF keeps track of the names, addresses,\\ndonation amounts and donation methods of non-anonymous donors. We normally send\\na postal or email “thank you” letter when we receive your donation over $100.\\n\\nWe do not provide any information about donors to any party outside of PGLAF and\\nits employees and contractors for any purpose, except if required by law.
