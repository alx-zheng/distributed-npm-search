New books are then available for download, typically within 2 hours.\\nThe list has a once-daily digest option, and also online public archives.\\n\\n\\nSOCIAL MEDIA\\n\\n\\nSOCIAL MEDIA\\n\\n * Facebook Icon [/gutenberg/f_icon.png]\\n   https://www.facebook.com/project.gutenberg\\n * Twitter Icon [/gutenberg/t_icon.png] https://twitter.com/gutenberg_org\\n * Mastodon Icon [/gutenberg/m_icon.png] https://mastodon.social/@gutenberg_org\\n * News feeds of new eBooks\\n * Facebook News Feed Icon [/gutenberg/f_news_icon.png]\\n   https://www.facebook.com/gutenberg.new\\n * Mastodon Icon [/gutenberg/m_news_icon.png]\\n   https://mastodon.social/@gutenberg_new\\n\\n\\nOPDS\\n\\nThe Open Publiation Distribution System is a method Project Gutenberg makes\\navailable to discover new eBooks. OPDS is primarily intended for\\nmachine-to-machine communication for use in applications that can present or\\nmanage the lists of content.\\n\\nTo use Project Gutenberg’s OPDS feed, start at\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search.opds/\\n[https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search.opds/].\\n\\n\\nLIST OF SITES HOSTING PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOKS\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg collection is available from dozens of sites offering\\naccess via http/https, ftp, rsync, and a few other methods. See our listing of\\nmirror sites [/dirs/MIRRORS.ALL] to choose the location, access method, or\\nspeed. Mirrors generally do not have a friendly Web-based front end, but do have\\nthe collection. See the mirroring how-to [/help/mirroring.html] for details.\\n\\n\\nTHE GUTINDEX LISTINGS OF EBOOKS\\n\\nUpdated at least monthly. These plain text files provide the basic information\\nabout each eBook, and are good for searching from your own system (for example,\\nuse control-F in a Web browser or word processor). They are the accession lists\\nfor Project Gutenberg. Note that these files are not recommended for automation\\n(that is, to use as input to generate a computerized database). Instead, use one\\nof the catalog files mentioned below.\\n\\n * GUTINDEX.ALL [/dirs/GUTINDEX.ALL]\\n * GUTINDEX.zip [/dirs/GUTINDEX.zip] (same as above zipped)\\n\\n\\nGUTINDEX LISTINGS BY YEAR\\n\\nIf GUTINDEX.ALL is too big for you or you prefer separate annual lists, you can\\ndownload GUTINDEX files by year.\\n\\n * GUTINDEX.2024 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2024]\\n * GUTINDEX.2023 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2023]\\n * GUTINDEX.2022 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2022]\\n * GUTINDEX.2021 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2021]\\n * GUTINDEX.2020 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2020]\\n * GUTINDEX.2019 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2019]\\n * GUTINDEX.2018 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2018]\\n * GUTINDEX.2017 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2017]\\n * GUTINDEX.2016 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2016]\\n * GUTINDEX.2015 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2015]\\n * GUTINDEX.2014 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2014]\\n * GUTINDEX.2013 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2013]\\n * GUTINDEX.2012 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2012]\\n * GUTINDEX.2011 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2011]\\n * GUTINDEX.2010 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2010]\\n * GUTINDEX.2009 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2009]\\n * GUTINDEX.2008 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2008]\\n * GUTINDEX.2007 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2007]\\n * GUTINDEX.2006 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2006]\\n * GUTINDEX.2005 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2005]\\n * GUTINDEX.2004 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2004]\\n * GUTINDEX.2003 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2003]\\n * GUTINDEX.2002 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2002]\\n * GUTINDEX.2001 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2001]\\n * GUTINDEX.2000 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.2000]\\n * GUTINDEX.1999 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.1999]\\n * GUTINDEX.1998 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.1998]\\n * GUTINDEX.1997 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.1997]\\n * GUTINDEX.1996 [/dirs/GUTINDEX.1996] (and earlier)\\n\\n\\nAFFILIATE SITES\\n\\nNot part of Project Gutenberg - check laws of the country where you are, before\\naccessing or redistributing any eBooks.\\n\\n * GUTINDEX.AUS, Project Gutenberg of Australia [/dirs/GUTINDEX.AUS]\\n\\n\\nDIRECTORY/FOLDER LISTINGS\\n\\nYou can navigate the directory/folder contents starting at /dirs [/dirs],\\nhowever this is not very user-friendly.\\n\\n\\nTHE PROJECT GUTENBERG CATALOG METADATA IN MACHINE-READABLE FORMAT\\n\\n\\nXML/RDF/CSV\\n\\nAll Project Gutenberg metadata are available digitally [/cache/epub/feeds/] in\\nthe XML/RDF format. This is updated daily (other than the legacy format\\nmentioned below). Please use one of these files as input to a database or other\\ntools you may be developing, instead of crawling or roboting\\n[/policy/robot_access.html] the website.\\n\\nNote that the exact same metadata is available as a per-eBook .rdf file. These\\nare found in the cache/epub (i.e., cache/generated) directory, accessible by\\nmirroring or by the directory/folder listings above. The large XML/RDF file is\\nsimply a concatenation of all the per-eBook metadata.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg metadata does not include the original print source\\npublication date(s). Because Project Gutenberg eBooks are substantially\\ndifferent from the source book(s), we track the Project Gutenberg publication\\ndate (“release date”), but do not include print source information in the\\nmetadata. Differences almost always include dehyphenation, removing page\\nheaders/footers, changes to typography during markup, and sometimes relocation\\nof images, footnotes, captions, etc. In addition, Project Gutenberg eBooks\\nsometimes come from multiple print editions.\\n\\nMany eBooks include scans of the title page or other pages, which may indicate\\noriginal print publication. If matching a Project Gutenberg eBook to a\\nparticular print edition is important to you, it is likely this will need to be\\ndone by direct comparison of a print source with the eBook.\\n\\nAn Excel-compatible CSV spreadsheet of eBook metadata is also available here\\n[/cache/epub/feeds/pg_catalog.csv]. This file is updated once a week.\\n\\n\\nMARC RECORDS (MACHINE READABLE CATALOGING): NO LONGER AVAILABLE\\n\\nProject Gutenberg distributed the catalog in MARC format, and then discontinued\\nwhen server upgrades left our software non-functional. In addition, a legacy\\nprogram prepared by a volunteer, pgrdf2marc.pl [/gutenberg/pgrdf2marc.pl.txt],\\nworked with a previous version of the XML/RDF data, but does not work with the\\ncurrrent version.\\n\\n\\nA LOCAL, BROWSABLE COPY ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER OR MOBILE DEVICE\\n\\nKiwix [https://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Content] is an application that lets you\\ndownload a large collection and use it locally. A copy of the Project Gutenberg\\ncontent was made available in November 2018, and may be updated periodically.\\n\\n * Privacy policy [/policy/privacy_policy.html]\\n * About Project Gutenberg [/about/]\\n * Terms of Use [/policy/terms_of_use.html]\\n * Contact Information [/about/contact_information.html]\\n * Get Help [/help/]\\n\\niBiblio [/gutenberg/ibiblio-logo.png] https://www.ibiblio.org/\"}"}}
