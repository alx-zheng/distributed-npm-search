Visitors who are minors should be accompanied by an adult, and some content\\nmay be unsuitable for some readers, of any age.\\n\\nNon-US persons are advised to check copyright laws of their country before\\naccessing any eBooks or other content from Project Gutenberg. Some content may\\nbe copyrighted, or otherwise restricted, for use in other countries. Project\\nGutenberg offers no warranty or assurances about copyright status or freedom to\\naccess or use its materials outside of the United States.\\n\\nContents\\n 1. Trademark License\\n 2. Website Terms of Use\\n    1. Audience\\n    2. Deep Linking\\n    3. Embedding or Wrapping our Site or Contents\\n    4. OPDS Feed\\n    5. Automated Blocks\\n 3. Footnotes\\n\\n\\nTRADEMARK LICENSE\\n\\nWhat you are allowed to do with our eBooks once you download them: See: the\\nProject Gutenberg License [/policy/license.html] and the Permission How-To\\n[/policy/permission.html].\\n\\n\\nWEBSITE TERMS OF USE\\n\\n\\nAUDIENCE\\n\\nThis website is intended for human users only. Any perceived use of automated\\ntools to access this website will result in a temporary or permanent block of\\nyour IP address.\\n\\n * If you want to download many books[1] manually or using an automated download\\n   software, download them from one of our mirrors, not from the main site. See\\n   the list of PG mirrors [//www.gutenberg.org/MIRRORS.ALL] and the roboting\\n   guidelines [/policy/robot_access.html].\\n * If you want a list of all our books, download and save the Gutenberg index\\n   file [//www.gutenberg.org/dirs/GUTINDEX.ALL] It can be opened with any\\n   browser or word processor.\\n * If you want a machine-readable database of all our books, read the Offline\\n   Catalogs and Feeds [/ebooks/offline_catalogs.html] page.\\n * If you are behind a proxy or VPN because you want anonymity or because of\\n   company or school policy, you may be blocked because other users of the same\\n   address are misbehaving. Try turning the proxy or VPN off.\\n * If you are using a commercial product that channels requests through a proxy\\n   (such as Amazon Kindle), your address may be blocked due to too much use from\\n   that shared proxy address. Instead, see our tablets, phones and eReaders\\n   how-to [/help/mobile.html] for guidance on how to download items to your own\\n   system, prior to transferring to the other device.\\n\\n\\nDEEP LINKING\\n\\nWhen linking to a Project Gutenberg item, link to the main landing page such as\\nwww.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11. Do not link to specific files or anchors, such as\\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-h/11-h.htm. Technical measures (i.e.,\\ncookies, captchas and similar) are utilized to ensure that links come from the\\nlanding page or elsewhere within www.gutenberg.org. If you need to link to a\\nspecific file or passage, please make your own copy of that file and host it on\\nyour own server. This measure is a protection against possible renaming or\\nreorganizing the back end file structure, which has happened several times over\\nthe years. We intend the landing page to be permanent.\\n\\n\\nEMBEDDING OR WRAPPING OUR SITE OR CONTENTS\\n\\nApplies mainly to website owners. We do not allow large-scale deep-linking to\\neBook files hosted on our servers. We reserve the right to take legal and\\ntechnical measures against this.\\n\\nWhile the books we host are free, our server infrastructure and bandwidth is\\nnot. It is paid with money generously made available by our donors and partners.\\nWe will not tolerate mock Gutenberg front-ends that pocket advertising revenues\\nwhile leaving the cost of actually serving the files to us.\\n\\n\\nOPDS FEED\\n\\nApplies to OPDS application developers. Every application that uses our OPDS\\nfeed must:\\n\\n * Use a proper user-agent, like: calibre/1.1.0 (+http://www.calibre.org).\\n   Always include a contact address like a web page or email, so we can reach\\n   you. Applications without contact address and application developers that do\\n   not respond to our inquiries will be blocked from using our OPDS feed.\\n * Make no more requests to our servers than a user with a browser typically\\n   would make (eg. for every search, request only one page of results, and\\n   automatically request the next page only if the users scrolls to the bottom\\n   of the previous page). If your application makes lots of requests, your users\\n   will be blocked at the IP level. For high-volume OPDS applications consider\\n   downloading our catalog database [/ebooks/offline_catalogs.html] and hosting\\n   your own OPDS feed. If you have special needs, contact us\\n   [/about/contact_information.html], don’t try to `hack around´.\\n\\n\\nAUTOMATED BLOCKS\\n\\nBlocks to Internet addresses (IP addresses) are applied automatically based on\\nthe volume of traffic and related factors. Such blocks automatically expire\\nafter a few days.\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES\\n\\n * ↑ Many books: i.e., more than ~100 per day\\n\\n * Privacy policy [/policy/privacy_policy.html]\\n * About Project Gutenberg [/about/]\\n * Terms of Use [/policy/terms_of_use.html]\\n * Contact Information [/about/contact_information.html]\\n * Get Help [/help/]\\n\\niBiblio [/gutenberg/ibiblio-logo.png] https://www.ibiblio.org/\"}"}}
