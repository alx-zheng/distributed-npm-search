Poetry is a great compliment to this wonderful time of the year: the\\nGreek ‘poiesis’ (ποίησις), from ποιέω ‘to make’, reflects the rejuvenation many\\nof us feel during springtime. See below for a couple of ways to access poetry\\nthrough ibiblio!\\n\\nThere are a couple of notable ways to access poetry via ibiblio – Project\\nGutenberg [https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/bookshelf/60] and the Internet\\nPoetry Archive [http://www.ibiblio.org/ipa/index.php]. Project Gutenberg may\\nalready be familiar to some users. The project is overseen by the PGLAF\\n[https://www.gutenberg.org/about/pglaf.html] and acts as an online library of\\nfreely downloadable eBooks. Via Project Gutenberg, readers can connect with an\\nexpansive library of literature both new and old. To view poetry available\\nthrough Project Gutenberg, navigate to ‘Bookshelves’ via ‘Search and Browse’.\\nFrom there, you can select the ‘Poetry’ category and sort by title, author,\\nrelease date, or popularity.\\n\\nThe Internet Poetry Archive [http://www.ibiblio.org/ipa/index.php], created by\\nibiblio founder Paul Jones, aims to “make poetry accessible to new audiences\\n[providing] teachers and students of poetry new ways of presenting and studying\\n[contemporary] poets and their texts.” Follow the link to explore the writings\\nof poets like Seamus Heaney [http://ibiblio.org/ipa/heaney.php], Margaret Walker\\n[http://ibiblio.org/ipa/walker.php], and Yusef Komunyakaa\\n[http://ibiblio.org/ipa/komunyakaa.php]. Also, see Paul Jones’ webpage\\n[https://www.ibiblio.org/pjones/blog/poetry-publications-may-2020-present/] for\\na selection of his recently published poetry.\\n\\nPlease enjoy this springtime poem by Gerard Manley Hopkins\\n[https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22403]. Happy reading!\\n\\nSpring\\n\\nNOTHING is so beautiful as spring—\\nWhen weeds, in wheels, shoot long and lovely and lush;\\nThrush’s eggs look little low heavens, and thrush\\nThrough the echoing timber does so rinse and wring\\nThe ear, it strikes like lightnings to hear him sing;\\nThe glassy peartree leaves and blooms, they brush\\nThe descending blue; that blue is all in a rush\\nWith richness; the racing lambs too have fair their fling.\\n\\nWhat is all this juice and all this joy?\\nA strain of the earth’s sweet being in the beginning\\nIn Eden garden. Have, get, before it cloy,\\nBefore it cloud, Christ, lord, and sour with sinning,\\nInnocent mind and Mayday in girl and boy,\\nMost, O maid’s child, thy choice and worthy the\\nwinning.\\n\\nPosted on 4 March 2024\\n[https://www.ibiblio.org/archive/2024/03/poetry-available-through-ibiblio/]Author\\nwshahn [https://www.ibiblio.org/archive/author/wshahn/]Categories Collections\\n[https://www.ibiblio.org/archive/category/collections-2/]\\n\\n\\nSOUNDEXCHANGE AND DIGITAL AUDIO STREAMING\\n[https://www.ibiblio.org/archive/2024/01/soundexchange-and-digital-audio-streaming/]\\n\\nibiblio hosts several digital audio streams, all of which broadcast copyrighted\\nmaterial regularly. You may have wondered, “How are intellectual property owners\\npaid when their recordings are broadcast online?” In the USA, royalties are owed\\nto intellectual property owners each time a sound recording is played. An\\norganization that centralizes management of these these rights for public radio\\nstations that stream online is SoundExchange. Additionally, SoundExchange\\nprovides payments to artists and intellectual property owners when their music\\nis broadcast online. To ensure an equitable distribution of royalties, data\\nassociated with the sound recording is processed, and a payment is collected\\nfrom the statutory licensee. Then, shares are allocated, processed, and\\ndistributed to the intellectual property owners. You can follow this link\\n[https://www.soundexchange.com/] to visit SoundExchange’s official website.\\nAdditionally, you can learn more about SoundExchange’s history and purpose via\\nthe associated Wikipedia page [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundExchange].\\n\\nSoundExchange compliance helps to ensure that royalties from broadcast sound\\nrecordings are distributed properly. Each audio stream we host must send\\nSoundExchange reports to ensure royalties are properly distributed. One of the\\nmost important things this report includes is the total number of times a\\nrecording is received by a unique listener. This is known as the actual total\\nperformances, or more colloquially as “per play, per listener.” Our audio\\nstreams produce logs which we can then compile into a report for SoundExchange.\\nActual total performances is used to calculate the amount owed by a radio\\nstation to the intellectual property owners.\\n\\nEquitable distribution of royalties helps keep the digital audio streams we host\\nsustainable. You can visit some of these radio stations and access their online\\nstreams for your music listening pleasure. Here are a few of the radio stations\\nwe host:\\n\\n * * Concierto [https://audio-mp3.ibiblio.org/concierto] – Spanish/English\\n     classical music produced by WDAV\\n   * WCPE, The Classical Station [https://audio-mp3.ibiblio.org/wcpe.mp3]\\n   * WXYC [https://audio-mp3.ibiblio.org/wxyc.mp3] – UNC-Chapel Hill’s student\\n     radio station\\n\\nPosted on 24 January 2024\\n[https://www.ibiblio.org/archive/2024/01/soundexchange-and-digital-audio-streaming/]Author\\nwshahn [https://www.ibiblio.org/archive/author/wshahn/]Categories Collections\\n[https://www.ibiblio.org/archive/category/collections-2/]\\n\\n\\nWINTER READS WITH PROJECT GUTENBERG\\n[https://www.ibiblio.org/archive/2023/12/winter-reads-with-project-gutenberg/]\\n\\nThis collection of books and short stories contains recommendations perfect for\\ncold weather and the holiday season.
