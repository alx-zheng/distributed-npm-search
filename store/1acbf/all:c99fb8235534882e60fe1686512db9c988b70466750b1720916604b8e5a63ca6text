You may not even make a copy of the\\nbook and give it to your best friend. But if the book you got is free as in\\nfreedom you may do anything you like with that book. Clearly free as in freedom\\nbeats free of charge.\\n\\nFortunately almost all Project Gutenberg eBooks are free of charge and free as\\nin freedom for readers within the United States (if you are not in the United\\nStates, you will need to determine what copyright law protects where you are\\nlocated).\\n\\nHere are some real world examples of what people did with Project Gutenberg\\neBooks.\\n\\nA few Project Gutenberg eBooks are protected by U.S. copyright law. You can tell\\nby reading the license inside the book. You may download our copyrighted books\\nand give copies away, but might be limited in commercial uses and derivative\\nworks.\\n\\n\\nWHY ARE THESE BOOKS FREE?\\n\\nCopyright [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright] For the most part, copyright\\nprotection under U.S. law on the materials distributed by Project Gutenberg has\\nexpired. (They may still be copyrighted in other countries). So anybody located\\nin the United States may make verbatim or non-verbatim copies of those works.\\n\\n\\nREAD MORE ABOUT COPYRIGHTS\\n\\n * Wikipedia: Copyright [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright]\\n * Wikipedia: Public Domain [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Domain]\\n * Wikipedia: United States Copyright Law\\n   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_copyright_law]\\n\\n * Privacy policy [/policy/privacy_policy.html]\\n * About Project Gutenberg [/about/]\\n * Terms of Use [/policy/terms_of_use.html]\\n * Contact Information [/about/contact_information.html]\\n * Get Help [/help/]\\n\\niBiblio [/gutenberg/ibiblio-logo.png] https://www.ibiblio.org/\"}"}}
