Trying to figure out how to put these very expensive hours\\nto good use, he envisaged a time when there would be millions of connected\\ncomputers, and typed in the Declaration of Independence (all in upper case–there\\nwas no lower case available!). His idea was that everybody who had access to a\\ncomputer could have a copy of the text. Now, decades later, his copy of the\\nDeclaration of Independence [/ebooks/1] (with lower-case added!) is still\\navailable to anyone, anywhere.\\n\\nDuring the 1970s, Michael added some more classic American texts, and through\\nthe 80s worked on the Bible and the collected works of Shakespeare. That edition\\nof Shakespeare was never released, due to copyright law changes, but others\\nfollowed.\\n\\nStarting in 1991, Project Gutenberg began to take its current form, with many\\ndifferent texts and defined production targets for new eBooks. The target for\\n1991 was one book per month. 1992’s target was two books each month. This target\\ndoubled every year through 1996, when it hit 32 books a month.\\n\\nThere is more history and background in the Background, History and Philosophy\\n[/about/background/] section.\\n\\n\\nTELL ME ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG’S LONGEVITY\\n\\nProject Gutenberg is the original, and oldest, eBook project on the Internet,\\nfounded in 1971. It is one of the oldest online content providers in the world\\nthat is still operating.\\n\\n\\nWHO RUNS PROJECT GUTENBERG?\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization,\\nwhich operates Project Gutenberg. Dr. Gregory B. Newby is our volunteer CEO.\\nProfessor Michael Hart was our Founder and Executive Director. Michael died in\\n2011, and you can read obituary and memorial information here\\n[/attic/hart.html].\\n\\nIn terms of the day-to-day production of eBooks, our volunteers run\\nthemselves. :-) They produce books, and submit them when completed. The Posting\\nTeam, known as “whitewashers” after Mark Twain’s Tom Sawyer, checks submitted\\neBooks and shepherds them online.\\n\\n\\nHOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN PROJECT GUTENBERG?\\n\\nOver the years, we estimate that over 10,000 people have helped Project\\nGutenberg, either by submitting new eBooks, or having some other role in support\\nof Project Gutenberg.\\n\\n\\nHOW CAN I HELP PROJECT GUTENBERG?\\n\\nProduce a new eBook! The easiest way to get started is with Distributed\\nProofreaders [https://www.pgdp.net], where you can find a self-paced tutorial\\nand a supportive community of volunteers.\\n\\nDonate money! We’re an all-volunteer project, and we don’t have much to spend,\\nso even a little goes a long way. Read more about donating to Project Gutenberg.\\n[/donate/]\\n\\nHelp improve our eBooks! If you find an error, or something missing - or perhaps\\nyou have a suggestion for our website - please get in touch\\n[/about/contact_information.html].\\n\\nSpread the word! Invite your friends and colleagues to visit Project Gutenberg.\\nWhen you find something you like, share it! See the Terms of Use\\n[/policy/terms_of_use.html] for details and limitations.\\n\\n\\nWHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROJECT GUTENBERG, PROJECT GUTENBERG OF CANADA,\\nPROJECT GUTENBERG OF EUROPE, PROJEKT GUTENBERG-DE, PROJECT GUTENBERG OF\\nAUSTRALIA, AND PROJECT RUNEBERG?\\n\\nThose are all entirely separate organizations. In many cases, Michael Hart gave\\npermission for them to use the “Project Gutenberg” name, which is a registered\\ntrademark.\\n\\nThese site operate within the copyright rules of their respective countries, and\\nmay have specific focus on particular types of national works or languages.\\n\\n\\nABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG PUBLICATIONS\\n\\n\\nDOES PROJECT GUTENBERG PUBLISH ONLY BOOKS?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nIn the past, Project Gutenberg also published other cultural works like movies\\nand music, but the bulk of our collection is books, and there are other online\\nprojects that do a better job with other types of content.\\n\\nFor more details, see the collection development\\n[/policy/collection_development.html] policy.\\n\\n\\nWHAT BOOKS DOES PROJECT GUTENBERG PUBLISH?\\n\\nAny books that meet our collection development policy, and that our volunteers\\nwant to work on.\\n\\nWe do not publish any books that still have copyright protection. This generally\\nmeans that our texts are taken from books published 95+ years ago. (It’s more\\ncomplicated than that, as our Copyright FAQ [/help/copyright.html] explains, but\\n95+ criterion is a good first rule-of-thumb.)\\n\\nThis means that you won’t find the latest bestsellers or modern computer books\\nhere. You will find the classic books from the start of the 20th century and\\nprevious centuries, from authors like Shakespeare, Poe, Dante, as well as\\nwell-loved favorites like the Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,\\nthe Tarzan and Mars books of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Alice’s adventures in\\nWonderland as told by Lewis Carroll, and thousands of others.\\n\\nThese books are chosen by our volunteers. Simply, a volunteer decides that a\\ncertain book should be in the library, obtains the book and does the work\\nnecessary to turn it into an eBook. Most of our new eBooks now come from\\nDistributed Proofreaders [https://www.pgdp.net]. Historically, we had many\\n“solo” eBook producers, but this is less frequently seen these days.\\n\\nTwo websites have a description of the copyright process, and the various checks\\nand requirements for uploading a new eBook that has been given a copyright\\nclearance. For copyright, see copy.pglaf.org [https://copy.pglaf.org]. For\\nuploads and compliance checks, see upload.pglaf.org [https://upload.pglaf.org].\\n\\n\\nWHAT OTHER THINGS HAS PROJECT GUTENBERG PUBLISHED IN THE PAST?\\n\\nWe have published some music files, in MIDI and MUS formats. We have published\\nthe Human Genome. We have published pictures of the prehistoric cave painting\\nfrom the south of France. We have published some video files and some audio\\nfiles, including tracks by award-winning singer/songwriter Janis Ian and\\nreadings from public domain books.\\n\\nNow, however, we only publish literary works that were previously published. The\\ncollection development [/policy/collection_development.html] policy has details.\\n\\n\\nHOW DOES PROJECT GUTENBERG CHOOSE BOOKS TO PUBLISH?\\n\\nProject Gutenberg, as such, does not choose books to publish. There is no\\ncentral list of works that volunteers are asked to work on. Individual\\nvolunteers choose and produce eBooks from printed books according to their own\\ntastes and values, and the availability of a suitable printed book for\\ndigitization.\\n\\n\\nWHAT LANGUAGES DOES PROJECT GUTENBERG PUBLISH IN?\\n\\nWhatever languages we can! As above, this is decided by what languages our\\nvolunteers choose to work with.\\n\\n\\nWHY DON’T YOU HAVE ANY / MANY BOOKS ABOUT HISTORY, GEOGRAPHY, SCIENCE,\\nBIOGRAPHY, ETC.? WHY AREN’T THERE ANY / MORE PG BOOKS AVAILABLE IN FRENCH,\\nSPANISH, GERMAN, ETC.?\\n\\nIf a book meets our collection development policy, and it isn’t in the library,\\nit’s because no volunteer has produced it yet. At the moment, we have a\\npredominance of English language novels because that is what most people have\\nchosen to work on.\\n\\nWe’re always looking for new languages and topics, and always delighted to see\\npeople producing them. If we don’t have enough of the types of books you would\\nlike to see, why don’t you help us out by contributing one? If the people\\ninterested in a particular area don’t contribute, we’ll always be short in that\\narea.\\n\\n\\nWHY DON’T YOU HAVE ANY BOOKS BY STEPHEN KING, TOM CLANCY, TOLKIEN, ETC.?\\n\\nProject Gutenberg can publish only books that are in the public domain in the\\nUnited States. Current bestsellers have not yet entered the public domain.\\n\\n\\nWHY IS PROJECT GUTENBERG SO SET ON USING PLAIN TEXT?\\n\\nProject Gutenberg supports and publishes many open formats, but, yes, we do want\\nto have a plain text version of everything possible.\\n\\nWe’re looking at our history, and we’re planning for the long term–the very long\\nterm.\\n\\nToday, plain text can be read, written, copied and printed by just about every\\nsimple text editor on every computer in the world. This has been so for decades,\\nand is likely to be so for the foreseeable future. We’ve seen formats and\\nextended character sets come and go; plain text stays with us. We can still read\\nShakespeare’s First Folios, the original Gutenberg Bible, the Domesday Book, and\\neven the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Rosetta Stone (though we may have trouble with\\nthe language!), but we can’t read many files made in various formats on computer\\nmedia just 20 years ago.\\n\\nWe’re trying to build a library that will last not only decades, but centuries.\\n\\nThe point of putting works in the PG library is that they are copied to many,\\nmany public sites and individual computers all over. No single disaster can\\ndestroy them; no single government can suppress them. Long after we’re all dead\\nand gone, when the very concept of an Internet Service Provider is as quaint as\\ngas streetlamps, when HTML reads like Middle English, those texts will still be\\nsafe, copied, and available to our descendants.\\n\\nThe PG library is so valuable, yet free and easily portable, that even if every\\ncurrent PG volunteer vanished overnight, people around the world would copy and\\npreserve any item that is legal for them to have in their country. For people in\\nthe US, this is 100% of the collection!\\n\\nAlso see the File Formats FAQ [/help/file_formats.html] for more detailed\\ndiscussion of formats.\\n\\n * Privacy policy [/policy/privacy_policy.html]\\n * About Project Gutenberg [/about/]\\n * Terms of Use [/policy/terms_of_use.html]\\n * Contact Information [/about/contact_information.html]\\n * Get Help [/help/]\\n\\niBiblio [/gutenberg/ibiblio-logo.png] https://www.ibiblio.org/\"}"}}
