To report an error within an eBook (such as a missing\\n    word or typo), please be sure to include the eBook number or specific\\n    filename or download link you used. Error reports are easiest to handle when\\n    they clearly indicate the context in which an error was found.\\n    \\n    Note that since Project Gutenberg includes many old titles, it is common for\\n    unusual spelling or arcane word uses to be used. If possible, check a\\n    printed source to verify whether an error exists, before reporting it.\\n    Messages to the errata list generate an automatic response that your report\\n    was received, within a few minutes.\\n    \\n    Any errata/bug/typo report is welcome! There is additional guidance in the\\n    FAQ on how to prepare errata reports so they are easiest for the Project\\n    Gutenberg team to handle.
