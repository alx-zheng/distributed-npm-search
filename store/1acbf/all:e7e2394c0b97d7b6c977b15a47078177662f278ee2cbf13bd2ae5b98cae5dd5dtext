The Project\\nGutenberg collection has been built by the efforts of volunteers who, over many\\nyears, have selected and digitized a variety of written and other works. The\\ncollection continues to grow, as new works are submitted.\\n\\nContents\\n 1. What types of works are eligible?\\n 2. How is a Project Gutenberg eBook related to the source(s) it was based on?\\n 3. What topics and subject matter are accepted?\\n 4. Historical context\\n 5. Status of this policy\\n\\n\\nWHAT TYPES OF WORKS ARE ELIGIBLE?\\n\\nProject Gutenberg accepts only donations of eBooks (i.e., written works) that\\nare not currently protected by copyright in the United States. Such works are in\\nthe public domain. New Project Gutenberg eBooks are typically digitized versions\\nof books that were published long ago and for which any US copyright has\\nexpired.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg’s collection development focuses on literature and other\\nwritten works. Selections are made by volunteers with diverse interests, and\\nessentially all eligible submissions are welcome.\\n\\nThe basic eligibility criteria are:\\n\\n * Submitted eBooks are digitized versions of printed books, or similar items\\n   such as manuals, pamphlets, periodicals, travelogues, theses, journals, or\\n   chapbooks.\\n * Evidence is submitted via the copyright portal at https://copy.pglaf.org to\\n   enable Project Gutenberg to confirm the source - that is, the printed item(s)\\n   from which the eBook is derived - is in the public domain in the US.\\n * The eBook is submitted via the upload portal at https://upload.pglaf.org, and\\n   meets the requirements there for formatting and for proofreading accuracy.\\n * The resulting eBook is entirely free of any US copyrights. Importantly, this\\n   includes that the “sweat of the brow” effort to digitize the source is not an\\n   act of authorship, so is not eligible for copyright; and also that incidental\\n   or supplemental additions, such as transcriber’s notes, indices, improvements\\n   or supplements to artwork, or new cover art, are granted permanently to the\\n   public domain.\\n\\nSome types of items which are ineligible include:\\n\\n * Scans of books or other sources that have not been converted to\\n   machine-readable text and undergone proofreading and formatting to the\\n   requirements of the upload portal.\\n * Unpublished contemporary items, even if they are granted to the public domain\\n   by the author.\\n * Items that were not previously published or distributed.\\n\\n\\nHOW IS A PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK RELATED TO THE SOURCE(S) IT WAS BASED ON?\\n\\nProject Gutenberg eBooks are new works, derived from existing printed works.\\nProject Gutenberg does not require that its eBooks be exact representations of\\ntheir printed sources (i.e., facsimiles). Instead, the printed works are\\ntransformed into modern digital formats. This process typically includes\\nremoving page headers/footers, de-hyphenation, formatting or relocating\\nfootnotes and endnotes, adding internal links for table of contents and indices,\\nand many other improvements that are intended to yield an enjoyable reading\\nexperience.\\n\\nThere are strict criteria for file formats and compliance checks, which are\\ndocumented in the upload portal, but Project Gutenberg allows latitude for the\\nvolunteers who produce new eBooks to make choices about how to go about\\ndigitization. The producer may make stylistic choices, such as for page layout\\nor images, whether to indicate original page numbers from the source, how to\\nhandle footnotes or endnotes, and other aspects of how the printed item is\\ndigitized. Producers are encouraged to focus on presentation of the content and\\nstructure of the eBook, more than a particular visual presentation or layout.\\nThis is because Project Gutenberg eBooks are intended to be enjoyable, no matter\\nhow or where they are read, now and in the future. As such, production choices\\nshould not inhibit automated or non-automated creation of new derived formats.\\n\\n\\nWHAT TOPICS AND SUBJECT MATTER ARE ACCEPTED?\\n\\nThe eBooks in the Project Gutenberg collection are freely offered to readers for\\ntheir enjoyment, enlightenment, education, and entertainment. The collection\\nincludes eBooks on many topics. There is emphasis on literary works and\\nreference items of historical significance, because volunteers have focused on\\ndigitizing such works. Any eligible item, on any topic, is welcome.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg follows the principles of the American Library Association’s\\nFreedom to Read Statement (FTR), which may be found online at www.ala.org\\n[http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/freedomreadstatement].\\n\\nThis commitment means that Project Gutenberg does not avoid difficult or\\nunpopular topics. It also means that Project Gutenberg adds eBooks to its\\ncollection that contain language or ideas that are outdated, incorrect,\\noffensive, or otherwise inconsistent with today’s societal views, standards or\\nmorals.\\n\\nThe FTR relies on the US Constitution’s First Amendment right to freedom of\\nspeech and freedom of the press. Project Gutenberg was founded on the idea that\\nfree, unlimited access to the world’s literature is a pathway to literacy,\\neducation, opportunity, and enlightenment. It is inimical to these principles\\nthat the collection, or access to it, be restricted due to content.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg’s readers and contributors are encouraged to read the entire\\nFTR document. It presents a vision for how libraries and publishers, and the\\npeople behind them, may work together to “enrich the quality and diversity of\\nthought and expression.”\\n\\nThe FTR makes it clear that inclusion of an item in a library collection does\\nnot mean the ideas within it are endorsed by the library. “Publishers,\\nlibrarians, and booksellers do not need to endorse every idea or presentation\\nthey make available. It would conflict with the public interest for them to\\nestablish their own political, moral, or aesthetic views as a standard for\\ndetermining what should be published or circulated.”\\n\\nThe final paragraph of FTR nicely summarizes Project Gutenberg’s commitment to\\nbuilding a diverse and vibrant collection, and to not avoid inclusion of eBooks\\nbased on their topics or the ideas within them: “We state these propositions\\nneither lightly nor as easy generalizations. We here stake out a lofty claim for\\nthe value of the written word. We do so because we believe that it is possessed\\nof enormous variety and usefulness, worthy of cherishing and keeping free. We\\nrealize that the application of these propositions may mean the dissemination of\\nideas and manners of expression that are repugnant to many persons. We do not\\nstate these propositions in the comfortable belief that what people read is\\nunimportant. We believe rather that what people read is deeply important; that\\nideas can be dangerous; but that the suppression of ideas is fatal to a\\ndemocratic society. Freedom itself is a dangerous way of life, but it is ours.”\\n\\n\\nHISTORICAL CONTEXT\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg collection includes a number of items that do not meet the\\npublic domain or formatting criteria described above. The founder of Project\\nGutenberg, Michael Hart, invented eBooks in 1971, and the online library grew\\nsubstantially in the 1980s and 1990s. During that period of time, there were not\\nmany free collections of diverse literary works, and some of the modern\\nstandards we now rely on had not yet emerged (such as Unicode for representing\\ncharacter sets and HTML for textual markup).\\n\\nProject Gutenberg worked with many different content types, including audio\\nbooks, digitized sheet music, some movies, and quite a few copyrighted items\\nthat were donated by contemporary authors. By the early 2000s, it was clear that\\nProject Gutenberg was not as well-suited for those different content types as\\nfor public domain literature. There are now many other outlets for these other\\ntypes of works, including a self-publishing portal for contemporary authors that\\nis operated by a Project Gutenberg affiliate.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg will not remove or deprecate these previous items. They were\\nall donated and accepted with the best of intentions, and with the understanding\\nthat Project Gutenberg would provide for their long-term stewardship and\\nunlimited redistribution. Michael Hart expressed unending gratitude to all the\\npeople who contributed content, and who digitized previous works. Project\\nGutenberg remains grateful to all of its contributors and volunteers.\\n\\n\\nSTATUS OF THIS POLICY\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg collection development policy was approved by the Board of\\nDirectors of the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (PGLAF) in\\nNovember 2019. It was also endorsed by the Trustees of the Distributed\\nProofreaders Foundation.\\n\\nDay-to-day operation of the Project Gutenberg website, along with associated\\nworkflows and procedures, is by volunteers. The specific mechanisms applied to\\ngrow the Project Gutenberg collection are subject to change over time, within\\nthe guidance included in the collection development policy.\\n\\n * Privacy policy [/policy/privacy_policy.html]\\n * About Project Gutenberg [/about/]\\n * Terms of Use [/policy/terms_of_use.html]\\n * Contact Information [/about/contact_information.html]\\n * Get Help [/help/]\\n\\niBiblio [/gutenberg/ibiblio-logo.png] https://www.ibiblio.org/\"}"}}
