You do not need permission to\\n   do so. Link to any page, but see the following for linking to eBook files\\n   themselves:\\n * If you link to one of our eBooks, do not Link directly to specific eBook\\n   files, as the filenames or locations may change over time. Instead, link to\\n   the canonical eBook landing page, author page, or subject page. Landing pages\\n   are the site, followed by “ebooks,” followed by an eBook number. For example,\\n   http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48320\\n * We do not participate in link exchanges or provide external links to\\n   unaffiliated products, services or sites.\\n\\n\\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT LINKING\\n\\nThis page contains information for webmasters who want to link to our site.
