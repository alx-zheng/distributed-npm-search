Contemporary works are not being accepted for\\nthe collection.\\n\\nInstead, our partner, the World Library Foundation runs self.gutenberg.org\\n[http://self.gutenberg.org], the Project Gutenberg self-publishing portal. This\\nis a collection of author-contributed works. Works are generally submitted in\\nPDF format, and all ownership remains with the author. The self-publishing\\nportal subscribes to the Project Gutenberg principle of unlimited, free\\nredistribution of all works.\\n\\n\\nSUBMITTING TO THE SELF-PUBLISHING PORTAL\\n\\n 1. Visit self.gutenberg.org [http://self.gutenberg.org]\\n 2. Select “Get Published”\\n 3. Select “Individual Registration” and get your username set up (elibrary\\n    card).\\n 4. And then, when you go back to “Get Published” you will have ability to\\n    upload your book, and see upload status.\\n\\nDon’t forget to look at the Submission Guidelines under “Get Published”\\n\\nThe self-publishing portal accepts eBooks in PDF and other formats, and allows\\ndifferent types of licenses.\\n\\nThe review process takes a week or two, and then your author portal will be\\nupdated. There are automated messages about this - be sure to check whether\\nemail messages land in your spam folder.\\n\\nDue to the size of the database at World Library, it can take a month or even\\nlonger for new items to be searchable. You can check status of your book upload,\\nin your account dashboard (“My Uploads”).\\n\\nNote that the World Library Foundation, which operates the self-publishing\\nportal, has a helpdesk for support and any trouble you might encounter. Please\\ncontact them directly: support @ worldlibrary.org.\\n\\n\\nWHY DID PROJECT GUTENBERG STOP ACCEPTING CONTEMPORARY WORKS?\\n\\nMichael Hart, Project Gutenberg’s founder, was a great believer in\\nexperimentation and pushing limits. As one of the earliest active sites for\\nbooks, Project Gutenberg was a magnet for books in every possible format, and\\nmany copyrighted items were added with permission of the author.\\n\\nToday, there are many more mechanisms for authors to distribute their works\\nelectronically. Project Gutenberg’s website does not have, and will not have,\\nthe needed features and services for contemporary authors. For example, we do\\nnot accept works in Word or PDF (instead, master formats must include HTML,\\ntext, TeX and/or RsT). Another example is that our processes of putting new\\neBooks online is laborious, and is not a self-service process. This is simply\\nnot up to par with modern publishing platforms.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg’s website at www.gutenberg.org focuses on what we do best:\\ncareful digitization and free distribution of works for which copyright has\\nexpired.\\n\\n * Privacy policy [/policy/privacy_policy.html]\\n * About Project Gutenberg [/about/]\\n * Terms of Use [/policy/terms_of_use.html]\\n * Contact Information [/about/contact_information.html]\\n * Get Help [/help/]\\n\\niBiblio [/gutenberg/ibiblio-logo.png] https://www.ibiblio.org/\"}"}}
