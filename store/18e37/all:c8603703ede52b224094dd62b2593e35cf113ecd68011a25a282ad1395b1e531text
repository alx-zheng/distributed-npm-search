By\\nthe 1980s and early 1990s, the nascent Project Gutenberg collection was being\\ndistributed by file transfer, online bulletin board systems, and other\\nmechanisms available at the time.\\n\\nDuring that same period, Project Gutenberg’s collection grew. Project\\nGutenberg’s 100th eBook, released for January 1, 1994, represented increasing\\nmaturity of methods for creating eBooks from printed books. Better understanding\\nof copyright, in the digital age, was also emerging. A number of donated\\ncontemporary works were also added to the collection.\\n\\nBy the time the 10,000th eBook was released, for March 1, 2006, procedures for\\ncreating and distributing Project Gutenberg eBooks were similar to today’s\\npractices. Distributed Proofreaders [https://www.pgdp.net] emerged as the major\\nsource of new eBooks for Project Gutenberg, with a mature online platform for\\ncrowdsourcing the production of new eBooks. The website, now at\\nwww.gutenberg.org, had replaced FTP and older methods for providing information\\nabout eBooks.\\n\\nThe organization that supports Project Gutenberg remained small and devoted. In\\n2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation [https://www.pglaf.org]\\nwas formed. PGLAF is the non-profit corporation that operates and manages\\nProject Gutenberg.\\n\\nIncreased focus on quality control and common procedures helped to improve most\\nof the older ebooks, and give a similar look and feel to the library’s content.\\nIn the years since then, there has been more focus on usability for various\\nmobile readers, including mobile phones and tablets. A collection development\\n[/policy/collection_development.html] policy was approved.\\n\\nThe future will bring continued innovation, and ongoing focus on the mission of\\nProject Gutenberg: To encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks.\\n\\n\\n   2\\n\\n * 2DArt-How-to (old) [/attic/2DArt.html]\\n\\n\\n   C\\n\\n * Copyright Confirmation How-To (old) [/attic/copyright_confirmation.html]\\n\\n\\n   F\\n\\n * File Sharing How-To (old) [/attic/file_sharing.html]\\n\\n\\n   G\\n\\n * GNU Gettext Translation How-To (old) [/attic/gnu_gettext_translation.html]\\n * Greek How-To (old) [/attic/greek_how_to.html]\\n\\n\\n   H\\n\\n * HTML FAQ (old) [/attic/html_faq.html]\\n\\n\\n   M\\n\\n * Michael Hart's Eulogy [/attic/hart.html]\\n\\n\\n   P\\n\\n * PDAs and eBook Readers How-To (old) [/attic/pdas_ebook_readers.html]\\n * Project Gutenberg Header How-To (old) [/attic/project_gutenberg_header.html]\\n\\n\\n   S\\n\\n * Scanning FAQ (old) [/attic/scanning_faq.html]\\n * Sheet Music How-To (old) [/attic/sheet_music.html]\\n\\n\\n   T\\n\\n * Tools FAQ (old) [/attic/tools_faq.html]\\n\\n\\n   V\\n\\n * Volunteers' Voices (old) [/attic/volunteers_voices.html]\\n\\n\\n   W\\n\\n * Website Translation How-To (old) [/attic/website_translation.html]\\n * Word Processor FAQ (old) [/attic/word_processor_faq.html]\\n\\n * Privacy policy [/policy/privacy_policy.html]\\n * About Project Gutenberg [/about/]\\n * Terms of Use [/policy/terms_of_use.html]\\n * Contact Information [/about/contact_information.html]\\n * Get Help [/help/]\\n\\niBiblio [/gutenberg/ibiblio-logo.png] https://www.ibiblio.org/\"}"}}
