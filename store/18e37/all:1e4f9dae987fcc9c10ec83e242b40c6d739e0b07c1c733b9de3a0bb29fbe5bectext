Most such requests do not need a custom response,\\nsince permission is included in the items themselves (even for commercial use),\\nor in the narrative below.\\n\\nThis How-To provides responses to the most common inquiries. If your inquiry is\\nnot addressed, please email Dr. Newby [/about/contact_information.html] with\\nyour permission requests. Responses are typically received within a day or so\\n(or, re-send your request!).\\n\\nContents\\n 1.  Most permissions not needed\\n 2.  Terms of Use\\n 3.

Reporting errata\\n\\n\\nMOST PERMISSIONS NOT NEEDED\\n\\nMost permission requests we receive do not require a custom response. The vast\\nmajority of Project Gutenberg eBooks are in the public domain in the US. This\\nmeans that nobody can grant, or withhold, permission to do with this item as you\\nplease.\\n\\n“As you please” includes any commercial use, republishing in any format, making\\nderivative works or performances, etc. Read more about the public domain in\\nWikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain].\\n\\n\\nTERMS OF USE\\n\\nAll use of the web site and content at www.gutenberg.org is subject to its Terms\\nof Use. Find them on the main page of www.gutenberg.org [/].\\n\\n\\nTRADEMARK PERMISSION TO “TRADE ON” THE PROJECT GUTENBERG NAME\\n\\nThe name “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. The Small Print License\\n[/license] guides terms of use. Basically, you need to pay royalties for\\ncommercial use (mentioned below). This restriction is mainly to prevent you\\nselling things that might be mis-perceived as being sold and/or supported by\\nProject Gutenberg, when Project Gutenberg has no involvement. It is intended to\\nrecognize the value of the Project Gutenberg name.\\n\\nNo permission is needed for non-commercial use. So, for example, you can freely\\nredistribute any eBook, anywhere, any time, with or without the “Project\\nGutenberg” trademark included. The Small Print has more details. Note that if\\nyou are not in the US, you must confirm yourself whether an item is free to\\nredistribute where you are.\\n\\n\\nCREDITING\\n\\nNo permission is needed to credit Project Gutenberg as the source of something\\nyou use. This applies even for commercial use.\\n\\n\\nLINKING\\n\\nNo permission is needed to link to www.gutenberg.org or to any page or address\\nwithin it.\\n\\nTo link to a specific eBook, link to the landing page for that eBook, not to\\nspecific files. So, for example, you would link to\\nwww.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19033 rather than “deep linking” to the specific HTML,\\nplain text, etc. www.gutenberg.org prohibits deep links automatically (based on\\nthe HTTP referrer), because from time to time the underlying structure of an\\neBook might change.\\n\\nMore detail, mostly for webmasters, is in our linking [/policy/linking.html]\\ndocument.\\n\\n\\nPROJECT GUTENBERG AS PUBLISHER\\n\\nProject Gutenberg does not promise or enforce adherence to any particular source\\nitem. We typically make each eBook from a single print book, but sometimes\\nmultiple print books are used. Even with a single print book, we make many\\nchanges: spelling modernization, dehyphenation, conversion to HTML or other\\nformats, etc. Therefore, we are the publisher of our eBooks, even if print\\nsources were used from prior publishers.\\n\\nSometimes an eBook will include mention of its source, and even then, this is\\nnot intended in any way that our eBooks are identical to that source print book.\\n\\n\\nQUOTES AND EXTRACTS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ITEMS\\n\\nNo permission is needed to use quotes from Project Gutenberg items (in the US,\\nthis would be “fair use”). This applies for all use, including commercial use.\\nIn other words, no royalties are due for quotes even if they are used for\\ncommercial products.\\n\\nIt is always OK to cite Project Gutenberg as the publication source (see below\\nfor how to cite), and it is also OK to not cite Project Gutenberg: your choice.\\n\\n\\nCOPYRIGHT PAGE AND TRADEMARKS FROM SOURCE\\n\\nSometimes an eBook will include a transcription or image of the original title\\npage, verso (obverse) or other pages from a source print book used for the\\neBook. This may include a copyright statement, which will usually be before 1964\\n(see our “copyright how-to” [/help/copyright.html] for details). This does not\\nmean that item is still copyrighted. The header/footer in the eBook from Project\\nGutenberg will mention that such items are in the public domain in the US.\\n\\nSimilarly, eBooks might include images or text that are (or were) trademarks in\\nthe US or elsewhere. This might include print publisher names or marks,\\npublication associations, or marks depicted as images or words within the\\neBooks. Project Gutenberg is providing such items “as is,” with no\\nrepresentation of ownership, or whether any such marks are still active.\\n\\nIt is permitted, but not required, for our volunteer eBook producers to include\\nfront matter from print books they use.\\n\\n\\nCITING PROJECT GUTENBERG\\n\\nYou can use any standard bibliographic format to cite the eBooks you find in\\nProject Gutenberg. We use “Urbana, Illinois” as the publication source, since\\nthat is the long-time home of our efforts. Note that the publication date is\\nalso known as the “release date”, which is included in each Project Gutenberg\\neBook’s header information. Include illustrators, translators etc., as you would\\nfor any book. You should not cite Project Gutenberg or any eBook producers as\\n“editors” unless they actually say they are edited (this happens rarely),\\nbecause these eBooks are usually transcriptions, more or less, from printed\\nsources. Here is an example in an APA-type format.\\n\\nCarroll, Lewis. (2006). Alice in Wonderland. Urbana, Illinois: Project\\nGutenberg. Retrieved February 21, 2016, from www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19033.\\n\\nTo cite the entire collection or Web site:\\n\\nProject Gutenberg. (n.d.). Retrieved February 21, 2016, from www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nOf course, you should insert the actual year/date you accessed the item, and the\\nactual year of your visit to the site.\\n\\n\\nNO PAPERWORK\\n\\nProject Gutenberg does not fill out permission forms or otherwise grant\\npermission for public domain items. That’s what “public domain” means: nobody\\ncan grant permission.\\n\\nWe also do not process forms that somehow confirm non-copyright status. If you\\ndon’t trust the statement in an eBook that an item is in the public domain in\\nthe US, then some sort of form from the same place (PG) that made the public\\ndomain determination would be meaningless! If you need further assurances or\\nresearch that an item is in the public domain, we recommend you arrange for the\\nresearch yourself, to your own specifications.\\n\\n\\nUS ONLY\\n\\nPG is entirely based in the US, and we follow the United States laws for\\ncopyright. Not all items that are public domain in the US are public domain in\\nother countries, and vice versa. If you are operating outside of the US, you\\nshould get professional guidance on how to proceed for things like\\nredistributing Project Gutenberg’s content. For basic information about\\ncopyright elsewhere, try this link to the Online books page\\n[http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/okbooks.html].\\n\\n\\nNO “SWEAT OF THE BROW”\\n\\nProject Gutenberg claims no copyright for markup, formatting, spelling\\nmodernization, etc., and neither can you (at least in the United States). See\\nour No Sweat of the Brow How-To [/help/no_sweat_copyright.html]\\n\\n\\nFOR COPYRIGHTED CONTENT\\n\\nThere are thousands of items in the Project Gutenberg collection which are still\\nunder copyright protection. Each copyrighted item is clearly indicated as\\ncopyrighted in the eBook’s header. Unless there is an included license with the\\ncopyrighted item (such as a creative commons license), you will need to contact\\nthe copyright holder for any needed permission. Project Gutenberg cannot do this\\non your behalf, and does not have any ability to sublicense copyrighted works.\\n\\n\\nCOMMERCIAL USE OF PROJECT GUTENBERG TRADEMARK\\n\\nIf you use the Project Gutenberg name, which is a registered trademark, you need\\nto pay royalties for any commercial use (i.e., where you are trading on the\\nProject Gutenberg trademarked name). Terms are spelled out clearly in the\\nlicense included with each eBook, or read it here: License How-To\\n[/policy/license.html]\\n\\nIf your commercial project has only a minor use of the Project Gutenberg\\ntrademark (for example, one PG eBook, and 9 from another source), then royalties\\nare proportional. In this example of one in ten items from PG, you would pay\\nonly 1/10th of the royalties that would normally be due.\\n\\nIn particular, this means that any attempt to claim copyright on a Project\\nGutenberg item that’s in the public domain, even after you “add value,” will be\\ninvalid.\\n\\n\\nHIGHER RESOLUTION IMAGES\\n\\nIf you’re looking for higher resolution versions of our scans, you will probably\\nneed to find your own original and make your own scan. Many Project Gutenberg\\nvolunteers produce our scans, and we have no good way to track them down in\\norder to help you. The Distributed Proofreaders PGDP [http://www.pgdp.net] has\\nsome online forums (free registration required) where you can inquire after\\nitems that came from that source. Each eBook that DP contributes has a credit to\\nthem at the start.\\n\\n\\nMORE DETAILS ON ITEMS\\n\\nEach eBook is complete and self-contained. If you want more information about an\\nauthor, a publisher, the printed source(s) used, etc. and it’s not in the eBook,\\nwe probably don’t know either. Try another resource, such as your local\\nlibrarian. Project Gutenberg does not enforce adherence of its eBooks to any\\nparticular print source.\\n\\n\\nREPORTING ERRATA\\n\\nIf you find an error, please report it to the Errata Email address\\n[/about/contact_information.html]. Unfortunately there are many outstanding\\nerrata reports (because each report, even a trivial one, requires lots of\\nresearch and often uncovers other errors to be investigated). Our automated\\nsystem will hold your report until it can be attended to.\\n\\n * Privacy policy [/policy/privacy_policy.html]\\n * About Project Gutenberg [/about/]\\n * Terms of Use [/policy/terms_of_use.html]\\n * Contact Information [/about/contact_information.html]\\n * Get Help [/help/]\\n\\niBiblio [/gutenberg/ibiblio-logo.png] https://www.ibiblio.org/\"}"}}
