[https://www.npmjs.com/about], or npm for\\nshort, collects and uses data about you.\\n\\n\\nWHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT?\\n\\nThat depends on your personal situation, which is why you should read on and\\ndecide for yourself. But at a minimum, absolutely every npm user should\\nunderstand:\\n\\nThe npm public registry is for making software available to everyone online.\\n\\nBut: Software comes from people, and says something about us.\\n\\nSo: Think carefully about what packages to publish, what data you put in those\\npackages, and what others might do with that data.\\n\\nWhen you create an account, certain contact information is displayed publicly in\\nthe npm platform. And when you upload a package, your name and contact\\ninformation may become associated with that package.\\n\\nIf you find yourself in a jam, open a support ticket\\n[https://npmjs.com/support].\\n\\n\\nHOW DOES NPM COLLECT DATA ABOUT ME?\\n\\nnpm collects data about you:\\n\\n * when you use the npm command [https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm], the npx\\n   command [/cli/commands/npx] or another program to access the npm public\\n   registry [https://registry.npmjs.org/], Enterprise registries that npm hosts\\n   [https://www.npmjs.com/enterprise], private packages\\n   [https://www.npmjs.com/features], such as when you're publishing a software\\n   package, and APIs for functionality like account and permissions management\\n\\n * when you browse the npm website, npmjs.com [https://www.npmjs.com/]\\n\\n * when you use either the npm command or the website to create an npm account,\\n   update your account, and sign up for npm services\\n\\n * when you send support, privacy, legal, and other requests to npm\\n\\n * when working with and researching current and potential customers\\n\\nWhen researching potential customers, npm staff sometimes search the public\\nWorld Wide Web or paid business databases. Otherwise, npm doesn't buy or receive\\ndata about you from data brokers or other private services.\\n\\nnpm may inadvertently collect data about you if it is included in software\\npackages that you or others upload.\\n\\n\\nWHAT DATA DOES NPM COLLECT ABOUT ME, AND WHY?\\n\\n\\nNPM COLLECTS DATA ABOUT HOW YOU USE NPM SOFTWARE AND REGISTRIES\\n\\nWhen you use the npm command, the npx command, or other software to work with\\nthe npm public registry, an Enterprise registry that npm hosts, or private\\npackages, npm logs data that might be identified to you:\\n\\n * a random, unique identifier, called npm-session, for each time you run\\n   commands like npm install\\n\\n * the names and versions of your project's dependencies, their dependencies,\\n   and so on, that come from the npm public registry, but not of other\\n   dependencies, like Git dependencies [/cli/audit]\\n\\n * the versions of Node.js, the npm command, and the operating system you are\\n   using\\n\\n * an npm-in-ci header, showing whether the command was run on a continuous\\n   integration server\\n\\n * the scope of the package for which you ran npm install, as an npm-scope\\n   header\\n\\n * a referrer header that shows the command you ran, with any file or directory\\n   paths redacted\\n\\n * data about the software you're using to access the registry, such as the\\n   User-Agent string\\n\\n * network request data, such as the date and time, your IP address, and the URL\\n\\nnpm uses this data to:\\n\\n * fulfill your requests, such as by sending the packages you ask for\\n\\n * send you alerts about security vulnerabilities that may affect the software\\n   you're building, when you run npm install or npm audit\\n\\n * keep registries working quickly and reliably\\n\\n * debug and develop the npm command and other software\\n\\n * defend registries from abuse and technical attacks\\n\\n * compile statistics on package usage and popularity\\n\\n * prepare reports on trends in the developer community\\n\\n * improve search results on the website\\n\\n * recommend packages that may be relevant to your work\\n\\n\\nNPM COLLECTS DATA ABOUT HOW YOU USE THE WEBSITE\\n\\nWhen you visit www.npmjs.com [https://www.npmjs.com/], docs.npmjs.com [/], and\\nother npm websites, npm uses cookies, server logs, and other methods to collect\\ndata about what pages you visit, and when. npm also collects technical\\ninformation about the software and computer you use, such as:\\n\\n * your IP address\\n\\n * your preferred language\\n\\n * the web browser software you use\\n\\n * the kind of computer you use\\n\\n * the website that referred you\\n\\nnpm uses data about how you use the website to:\\n\\n * optimize the website, so that it's quick and easy to use\\n\\n * diagnose and debug technical errors\\n\\n * defend the website from abuse and technical attacks\\n\\n * compile statistics on package popularity\\n\\n * compile statistics on the kinds of software and computers visitors use\\n\\n * compile statistics on visitor searches and needs, to guide development of new\\n   website pages and functionality\\n\\n * decide who to contact about about product announcements, service changes, and\\n   new features\\n\\n\\nNPM COLLECTS ACCOUNT DATA\\n\\nMany features of npm services require an npm account. For example, you must have\\nan npm account to publish packages to the npm public registry.\\n\\nTo create an npm account, npm requires a working email address and an available\\nuser name. npm uses this data to provide you access to features and identify you\\nacross npm services, publicly and within npm.\\n\\nYou do not have to give your personal or legal name to create an npm account.\\nYou can use a pseudonym instead. You can also open more than one account.\\n\\nIf you sign up for an account, then npm will publish account data for the whole\\nworld to see on user pages like this one [https://www.npmjs.com/~kemitchell].\\nnpm also publishes account data through the npm public registry, which is\\navailable for everyone to see, and Enterprise registries that npm hosts for\\nothers to find with commands like npm owner ls tap.\\n\\nIf you give npm a personal name or names on social media like GitHub\\n[https://github.com/] and Twitter [https://twitter.com/] through the website,\\nlike when you include this on your profile or user page, npm publishes that data\\nalong with the email address and user name for the account. You don't have to\\ngive npm a personal name or any social media names, and you can remove this data\\nat any time by updating your user page.\\n\\nnpm uses your email to:\\n\\n * notify you about packages published using your account\\n\\n * reset your password and help keep your account secure\\n\\n * add metadata to packages that you publish\\n\\n * contact you in special circumstances related to your account or packages\\n\\n * contact you about support requests\\n\\n * contact you about legal requests, like DMCA takedown requests and privacy\\n   complaints\\n\\n * announce new npm product offerings, service changes, and features\\n\\n * send you tips about how to better use free and paid services\\n\\n * send you messages about paid services you might want\\n\\n\\nNPM COLLECTS PACKAGE DATA\\n\\nWhen you use npm publish or other software to publish packages to the npm public\\nregistry, an Enterprise registry that npm hosts, or as a private package, npm\\ncollects the contents of the package, plus metadata\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata], including your account data. Other npm\\nusers may also publish packages that include data about you, such as the fact\\nthat you contributed code to a package.\\n\\nnpm uses data in packages to provide those packages to you and others who\\nrequest them:\\n\\n * When you publish a package to the npm public registry, or change a package\\n   from private to public, npm makes the package and metadata available to\\n   everyone, online.\\n\\n * When you publish a package to an Enterprise registry that npm hosts, or as a\\n   private package, npm makes all of that data available to other users\\n   according to how the registry or the private packages account is configured.\\n   You may be able to configure who can access the package, or that may be up to\\n   others, such as the administrator of your company's Enterprise registry.\\n\\nMaking package data available to others allows them to download, build on, and\\ndepend on your work.\\n\\n\\nNPM COLLECTS PAYMENT CARD DATA\\n\\nTo sign up for paid services, npm requires your payment card data. npm itself\\ndoes not collect or store enough information to charge your card itself. Rather,\\nStripe [https://stripe.com/] collects that data on npm's behalf, and gives npm\\nsecurity tokens that allow npm to create charges and subscriptions.\\n\\nnpm uses your payment card data only to charge for npm services.\\n\\nnpm instructs Stripe [https://stripe.com/] to store your payment card data only\\nas long as you use paid npm services.\\n\\n\\nNPM COLLECTS DATA ABOUT CORRESPONDENCE\\n\\nnpm collects data about you when you send npm support requests, legal\\ncomplaints, privacy inquiries, and business inquiries. Those data usually\\ninclude your name and email address, and may include your company or other\\naffiliation.\\n\\nnpm uses contact data to:\\n\\n * respond to you\\n\\n * compile aggregate statistics about correspondence\\n\\n * train support staff and other npm personnel\\n\\n * review the performance of npm personnel who respond\\n\\n * defend npm from legal claims\\n\\n\\nNPM COLLECTS DATA ABOUT USE OF NPM.COMMUNITY\\n\\nnpm collects data about visits, user accounts, and forum data on npm.community\\n[https://npm.community/], the discussion forum for users of npm products and\\nservices. npm uses data from npm.community to collaborate with the development\\ncommunity, and to inform development decisions about the command-line interface\\nand other software.\\n\\n\\nDOES NPM SHARE DATA ABOUT ME WITH OTHERS?\\n\\nnpm shares account data with others as mentioned in the section about account\\ndata.\\n\\nnpm shares package data with others as mentioned in the section about package\\ndata.\\n\\nnpm publishes posts and other content you submit to npm.community\\n[https://npm.community/].\\n\\nnpm does not sell information about you to others. However, npm uses services\\nprovided by other companies to provide npm services. The types of service\\nproviders that npm uses include:\\n\\n * Companies that enable us to offer features on our website, such as to display\\n   your avatar\\n\\n * Companies that facilitate the efficient distribution of content\\n\\n * Cloud computing platforms and services that host our discussion forums\\n\\n * Services that assist with the detection of spam, scams, abuse others, or\\n   other violations of our terms of service [/policies/open-source-terms]\\n\\n * Payment processors\\n\\n * Platforms to help us receive, manage, and respond to support requests\\n\\n * Platforms for internal communication\\n\\n\\nNPM USES COOKIES\\n\\nnpm's website only uses cookies strictly necessary to provide, optimize and\\nsecure the website. For example, we use them to keep you logged in, remember\\nyour preferences, authenticate your device for security purposes, analyze your\\nuse of the service, compile statistical reports, and provide information for\\nfuture development of npm. The website uses internal cookies for analytics\\npurposes, not any third-party analytics or service providers.\\n\\nBy using the website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your\\ncomputer or device. If you disable your browser or device’s ability to accept\\nthese cookies, you will not be able to log in or use the website.\\n\\n\\nHOW CAN I MAKE CHOICES ABOUT DATA COLLECTION?\\n\\nYou choose what data the npm publish command includes in package data. You can\\nuse an .npmignore [/files/package.json#files] file in your package to keep\\nspecific files out of the package. You can also use a files list in package.json\\nfiles [/files/package.json#files] to instruct npm to include only specific files\\nthat you name, in addition to standard files like README files, LICENSE files,\\nand package.json.\\n\\nTo double check the data that you will share in a package that you plan to\\npublish, run the npm publish --dry-run command. If you are running an older\\nversion of the npm command, run the npm pack command to create a tarball\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)], then check its contents, such\\nas with tar tvzf $tarball.\\n\\nTo publish a package to the npm public registry, npm's terms of service require\\nyou to license npm to share it [/policies/open-source-terms#your-content]. If a\\npackage is made public, it is available for everyone online to see. However,\\nyour choice of public license for your package [/files/package.json#license] may\\naffect what others can do with data about you in your package.\\n\\nnpm does not respond to the Do Not Track HTTP header\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track].\\n\\n\\nWHERE DOES NPM KEEP DATA ABOUT ME?\\n\\nnpm stores account data, data about website use, data about registry use, and\\nprivate packages on servers in the United States of America. metadata about\\nthose packages worldwide, via content delivery networks.\\n\\nnpm stores package data published to Enterprise registries that npm hosts, plus\\nmetadata about them, in cloud computing zones of customers' choosing.\\n\\nBy using the npm platform, you consent to the collection and storage of your\\ndata as outlined in this section.\\n\\n\\nHOW DOES NPM HANDLE DATA UNDER THE EU GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION?\\n\\nnpm respects privacy rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679\\n[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG],\\nthe European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). npm processes\\n\\\"Personal Data\\\" on the following legal bases: (1) with your consent; (2) as\\nnecessary to perform our agreement to provide our services; and (3) as necessary\\nfor our legitimate interests in providing our services where those interests do\\nnot override your fundamental rights and freedom related to data privacy.\\nInformation we collect may be transferred to, and stored and processed in, the\\nUnited States or any other country in which we or our affiliates or\\nsubcontractors maintain facilities, as described above.\\n\\nIf you reside in the EEA, Switzerland, or United Kingdom, you are entitled to\\ncertain rights, like the right to:\\n\\n * complain about our data collection or processing actions with the supervisor\\n   authority concerned. You can find a list of data protection authorities here\\n   [http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm].\\n\\n * access to information held about you.\\n\\n * ask us to correct or amend inaccurate or incomplete information we have about\\n   you.\\n\\n * ask us to erase data that under certain circumstances, like (1) when it is no\\n   longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, (2) you withdraw\\n   consent and no other legal basis for processing exists, or (3) you believe\\n   your fundamental rights to data privacy and protection outweigh our\\n   legitimate interest in continuing the processing.\\n\\n * request that we restrict our processing if we are processing your data based\\n   on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public interest\\n   as an exercise of official authority (including profiling); using your data\\n   for direct marketing (including profiling); or processing your data for\\n   purposes of scientific or historical research and statistics.\\n\\nWhen you exercise your rights, npm may need to verify your identity and provide\\nus with information before we access records containing your information. If you\\nwant to exercise your rights, please contact npm by opening a support ticket\\n[https://npmjs.com/support]. We may have a reason under the law why we do not\\nhave to comply with your request or may comply with it in a more limited way\\nthan you anticipated. If we do, we will explain that to you in our response.\\n\\n\\nHOW DOES NPM HANDLE DATA UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT?\\n\\nnpm respects the rights of California residents under the California Consumer\\nPrivacy Act [https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa] (CCPA). Where we collect\\ninformation that is subject to the CCPA, that information we collect and your\\nrights are described below.\\n\\nCategories of personal information we collect:\\n\\n * Personal Identifiers:\\n   \\n   * Name and email address when you create an account. You will also be asked\\n     to create a username and we will assign one or more unique identifiers to\\n     your profile. We use this information to provide our services, respond to\\n     your requests, and send information to you.\\n   \\n   * We also collect your social media handle and basic account information if\\n     you provide it to us or interact with our services, such as our help desk,\\n     through social media.\\n   \\n   * We collect your payment information through our service provider, Stripe,\\n     as described above.\\n\\n * Internet or Other Electronic Network Activity Information: device identifiers\\n   such as IP address and user agent; the assigned unique IDs in cookies (as\\n   described below); information about how you arrived at and navigated through\\n   our Services.\\n\\n * Geolocation Data: We do not collect your specific longitude and latitude.\\n   However, we do collect imprecise location (e.g., your IP address).\\n\\n * Professional or employment-related information: If you apply for employment\\n   with us, information about your employment history.\\n\\n * Education information: If you apply for employment with us, information about\\n   your educational history.\\n\\nWe may collect any other information about you contained in software packages\\nuploaded to our site, as described above under the \\\"npm collects package data\\\"\\nsection. We also collect the contents of your communications with us, e.g., when\\nyou submit a question to us through a web form or comments to us on social\\nmedia.\\n\\nWe may disclose any of the categories of personal information listed above and\\nuse them for the above-listed purposes or for other business or operational\\npurposes compatible with the context in which the personal information was\\ncollected. Our disclosures of personal information include disclosures to our\\n\\\"service providers,\\\" which are companies that we engage for business purposes to\\nconduct activities on our behalf. The categories of service providers with whom\\nwe share information and the services they provide are described below.\\n\\nRights under CCPA:\\n\\n * Access/Right to Know: You have the right to request access to personal\\n   information we collected about you and information regarding the source of\\n   that personal information, the purposes for which we collect it, and the\\n   third parties and service providers with whom we share it.\\n\\n * Deletion: You have the right to request that we erase data we have collected\\n   from you. Please note that we may have a reason to deny your deletion request\\n   or delete data in a more limited way than you anticipated, e.g., because of a\\n   legal obligation to retain it.\\n\\nTo exercise your rights above, you can open a support ticket\\n[https://npmjs.com/support]. When we process your request, we must verify your\\nidentity by asking you to (1) provide personal identifiers that we can match\\nagainst information we may have collected from you previously; and (2) confirm\\nyour request using the email stated in the request.\\n\\nOpt-out of sale:\\n\\nCalifornia residents have the right to request that we stop \\\"selling\\\" their\\npersonal information. A \\\"sale\\\" of personal information is defined broadly:\\n\\\"selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available,\\ntransferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or\\nother means, a consumer's personal information by the business to another\\nbusiness or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.\\\" We do\\nnot sell your information as defined by the CCPA.\\n\\nPlease note that your right to opt out does not apply to our sharing of personal\\ninformation with service providers, who are parties we engage to perform a\\nfunction on our behalf and are contractually obligated to use the Personal\\nInformation only for that function.\\n\\nWe may also disclose information to other entities who are not listed here when\\nrequired by law or to protect our Company or other persons, as described in our\\nPrivacy Policy.\\n\\n\\nHOW CAN I SEE WHAT DATA IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ABOUT ME?\\n\\nYou can access your account data at any time by visiting your account page on\\nwww.npmjs.com [https://www.npmjs.com/]. Your account page also lists all the\\npackages published under your account or other accounts.\\n\\nYou can access package data by downloading the packages, as long as they're\\npublic or you have permission to access them.\\n\\nYou can see metadata about packages by running npm info $package, or by\\naccessing the appropriate registry's API\\n[https://github.com/npm/registry/tree/master/docs]. Registry APIs provide\\nmetadata in standard JSON [https://www.json.org/] format, and packages as\\ntarballs [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)].\\n\\n\\nHOW CAN I CHANGE DATA ABOUT ME?\\n\\nYou can change your personal account data and payment card data at any time by\\nvisiting your account settings page on www.npmjs.com [https://www.npmjs.com/].\\nYou can change account and payment data for Enterprise by contacting support\\n[https://npmjs.com/support].\\n\\nYou can close your npm account at any time by e-mailing contacting support\\n[https://npmjs.com/support]. Closing your account removes the profile from the\\npublic registry but does not automatically erase packages published under your\\naccount. We may retain some data about you internally even where you close your\\naccount.\\n\\nnpm's unpublish policy [/policies/unpublish] determines when you can erase\\npackages from the npm public registry. The unpublish policy strikes a difficult\\nbalance between the purpose of publishing and hosting packages, others' reliance\\non what has been made public, and individual rights and freedoms.\\n\\nIf another user improperly publishes personal data about you, in a package or\\notherwise, open a support ticket [https://npmjs.com/support].\\n\\nPlease note that while npm publishes notices about published data that's been\\nerased, npm can't make everyone who has downloaded published package data or\\naccount data erase that data on your behalf. Choosing a public license, such as\\nan open source software license, may encourage and allow storage, distribution,\\nand use of package data indefinitely. Nearly all popular open source software\\nlicenses actually require preserving personal data that attributes the software\\nto you, such as copyright notices, as a condition of permission for the\\nsoftware.\\n\\n\\nWHAT IS NPM'S POLICY ON UNPUBLISHING PACKAGES?\\n\\nPlease see our policy on \\\"unpublishing\\\" packages [/policies/unpublish] or our\\nterms of service [/policies/open-source-terms] for more information on erasing\\npackages.\\n\\nIf you accidentally publish a package that threatens your privacy, or discover\\nsomeone else has published a package that does, open a support ticket\\n[https://npmjs.com/support]. npm can and will take down packages in specific,\\nexceptional situations to protect you, especially if others violate your\\nprivacy. Using npm to violate others' privacy is against our terms of service\\n[/policies/open-source-terms].\\n\\n\\nHOW DOES NPM NOTIFY OTHERS ABOUT PUBLISHED DATA THAT'S ERASED?\\n\\nnpm takes a few steps to notify others who may be copying data from the npm\\npublic registry that published data has been erased:\\n\\n * npm publishes new placeholder versions of some erased packages, with README\\n   files that mention the package has been erased, and why.\\n\\n * npm's registry APIs [https://github.com/npm/registry/tree/master/docs],\\n   special software services that others use to copy data from the npm public\\n   registry, send update messages about packages that have been erased.\\n\\n\\nWHAT HAPPENS IF NPM MERGES WITH OR IS BOUGHT BY ANOTHER COMPANY?\\n\\nWe may transfer to another entity or its affiliates or service providers some or\\nall information about you in connection with, or during negotiations of, any\\nmerger, acquisition, sale of assets or any line of business, change in ownership\\ncontrol, or financing transaction. We cannot promise that an acquiring party or\\nthe merged entity will have the same privacy practices or treat your information\\nthe same as described in this Policy.\\n\\n\\nWHAT ARE NPM'S INFORMATION PRACTICES REGARDING INFORMATION BELONGING TO\\nCHILDREN?\\n\\nnpm's site and services are intended for users age sixteen and older. npm does\\nnot knowingly collect information from children. If we discover that we have\\ninadvertently collected information from anyone younger than the age of 16, we\\nwill delete that information.\\n\\n\\nWHO CAN I CONTACT ABOUT NPM AND MY PRIVACY?\\n\\nPlease open a support ticket [https://npmjs.com/support]. You may also contact\\nour Data Protection Officer directly.\\n\\nOur United States HQ:\\n\\nGitHub Data Protection Officer\\nAttention: npm Data Protection\\n88 Colin P.
