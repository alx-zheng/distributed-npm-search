Almost every Project Gutenberg eBook\\nsince 2004 is released as plain text and HTML, as master formats. Other formats,\\nsuch as epub and mobi, are generated automatically. A small number of items use\\nLaTeX as the master format, especially when mathematical notation is needed.\\nLaTeX is used to generate PDF.\\n\\nAn open format is one whose structure is publicly defined and documented, and\\nnot burdened with patent or trade secret or copy-protection (a.k.a. “DRM”)\\nrestrictions. Anyone can write a reader or creator for an open format, and in\\n500 years’ time, anyone interested will still be able to write a program to\\ndisplay the file. Closed formats, by contrast, will almost certainly be\\nunreadable in just a few decades, when the companies now promoting them\\ndisappear, or lose interest, or decide to stop supporting them because they want\\nto sell a replacement. In our notes below, you can see this has happened\\nnumerous times throughout the history of Project Gutenberg (1971-present).\\n\\nBeing able to edit an eBook’s files is also important. We make corrections to\\nour editions constantly, and it is important to us that we should be able to\\nupdate our files easily. If adding one word to a sentence involves a complete\\nre-marking of the whole text and a complete rebuild of the file, we have to ask\\nourselves whether this format is really necessary for this text. Further, the\\npeople who re-use our texts should also be allowed to copy and reformat them\\nfreely, and non-editable formats restrict their ability to do this in various\\nways.\\n\\n\\nWHAT IS, AND HOW DO I MAKE OR USE:\\n\\n[Note: Character sets and formats are both listed here. Character sets refer to\\nthe characters you can use; formats describe how those characters are put\\ntogether. For non-text formats such as music files, there is no exact equivalent\\nto a character set.]\\n\\n\\nASCII (CHARACTER SET)\\n\\nASCII was the historical master format for plain text. ASCII (American Standard\\nCode for Information Interchange) is a set of common characters, including just\\nabout everything that you can type in on an English-language keyboard. It\\nincludes the letters A-Z, a-z, space, numbers, punctuation and some basic\\nsymbols. Every character in this document is an ASCII character, and each\\ncharacter is identified with a number from 0 through 127 internally in the\\ncomputer.\\n\\nYou can view or edit ASCII text using just about every text editor or viewer in\\nthe world.\\n\\n\\nBIG-5 (CHARACTER SET)\\n\\nBig-5 is a set of 13,494 traditional Chinese characters. You will need to use an\\neditor or viewer that supports the character set.\\n\\n\\nCODEPAGE 437, 850, 1252, ETC. (CHARACTER SETS)\\n\\nThese codepages are Microsoft-specific character sets which allow the display of\\naccented characters and other symbols. To view a text that uses one of these,\\nyou will have to use a Microsoft application that supports them. Many of the\\nfonts supplied with Word for Windows will display and edit CP-1252 correctly.\\nFor Codepages 437 and 850, you may have to open a Command Prompt and use a DOS\\neditor like EDIT. A search form www.microsoft.com [https://www.microsoft.com]\\nshould bring up information about the codepage you’re interested in, or you can\\nread the excellent overview at aspell.net/charsets/codepages.html\\n[http://aspell.net/charsets/codepages.html]. For Unix users, iconv and recode\\nprovide translation facilities from one character set to another, and support\\nmany or all of the MS codepages.\\n\\n\\nDVI\\n\\nDVI stands for DeVice Independent, and is commonly used to store text and\\ninstructions for displaying it involving complex mathematical symbols and\\nexpressions, though it can be used for any content. Given a DVI file, you need a\\nviewer to render it on the specific device you’re using. Specifically, DVI is\\nused as the standard output format for TeX, discussed below.\\n\\n\\nEPUB\\n\\nThis is the format compatible with almost all eBook readers (ereaders),\\nsmartphones and tablets. The EPUB format is very similar to HTML, but has\\nadditional components that enable added functionality on the many types of\\ndevices that can use EPUB. This is now the recommended format for all ereader\\ndevices. See the tablets and ereaders help page [/help/mobile.html] for\\nadditional detail.\\n\\n\\nHTML/HTM (FORMAT)\\n\\nThis is the most frequently used master format. HyperText Markup Language\\ndefines the standard format of web pages. You should be able to view these with\\nany web browser, and edit them with any text editor or a specialized HTML\\neditor. www.w3.org [https://www.w3.org] is the definitive reference.\\n\\n\\nISO-8859/ISO-LATIN (CHARACTER SETS)\\n\\nISO-8859 is a series of character sets used to represent the accented characters\\nmost commonly used in European languages. There’s ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-2, and so\\non. ISO-Latin is just another name for the same thing. You can read the overview\\nat aspell.net/charsets/codepages.html\\n[http://aspell.net/charsets/codepages.html].\\n\\n\\nKF8\\n\\nThis is a new format for Amazon Kindle ereaders. Generally, Kindle with\\nup-to-date software can handle KF8 and EPUB equally well.\\n\\n\\nLIT (FORMAT FOR PDA-BASED EBOOKS)\\n\\nThis is a proprietary, closed format for files that can be displayed only by the\\nMicrosoft Reader. Search www.microsoft.com [https://www.microsoft.com] for more\\ninformation. It is not possible to edit or correct files in this format; it is\\nnot possible to export files from this format; they have to be made in another\\nformat and converted.\\n\\n\\nMACROMAN (CHARACTER SET)\\n\\nMacRoman is an 8-bit Apple Mac-specific character set which allows the display\\nof accented characters and other symbols. To view a text that uses MacRoman, you\\nwill have to use an application that supports it, and there are few outside the\\nApple fold. However, iconv and recode are programs that convert between many\\ncharacter sets, and MacRoman is supported by both.\\n\\n\\nMID/MIDI (FORMAT FOR MUSIC)\\n\\nMusical Instrument Digital Interface is a music description language,\\nencompassing not only file formats but definitions of interfaces. A MIDI file\\ncontains instructions for sending messages to a musical instrument to recreate\\nthe sounds. www.midi.org [https://www.midi.org/] has much more on this.\\n\\n\\nMOBI\\n\\nThis was the major format for Amazon’s Kindle ereaders, but was replaced in late\\n2022 by EPUB and KF8. You probably only need MOBI if you are using an older\\nKindle that has not had its software updated.\\n\\n\\nMP3 (FORMAT FOR ANY AUDIO FILE)\\n\\nMPEG-1, Level 3, was defined by the Moving Pictures Expert Group as a means for\\nencoding sounds. Many, many MP3 players exist for all platforms, and can be\\nfound easily with a Net search. The official home page of the MPEG is\\nwww.mpegstandards.org [https://www.mpegstandards.org/] and copies of the\\nspecification can be purchased from the ISO at www.iso.org\\n[https://www.iso.org].\\n\\n\\nMPEG/MPG (FORMAT FOR MOVING PICTURES)\\n\\nThe Moving Pictures Expert Group have released a series of formats for encoding\\nvideo and audio. MPEG (pronounced EM-peg) formats are published and widely used.\\nThe official home page of the MPEG is www.mpegstandards.org\\n[https://www.mpegstandards.org/] and copies of the specification can be\\npurchased from the ISO at www.iso.org [https://www.iso.org].\\n\\n\\nMUS (FORMAT FOR SHEET MUSIC)\\n\\nMUS from Coda Music (see this archived website\\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20070225021311/https://www.codamusic.com/]) is or\\nwas a proprietary, closed format for editing and replaying sheet music. However,\\nwe do post music files in this format because of its many features. We hope to\\nbe able to post these also in more open standards at some point in the future,\\nbut at the moment, there is no open format with similar capabilities.\\n\\n\\nPDB (FORMAT FOR PDA-BASED EBOOKS)\\n\\nThe Palm Data Base format can actually be used for purposes other than eBooks,\\nand there are many possible variants of formats for Palm-based readers all using\\nthe extension PDB on PCs, and they’re not all entirely compatible. Some of them\\nare proprietary, and it may not be possible to edit them directly, or export\\nfiles from these formats; they have to be made in another format and converted.\\nSome can be converted back to text. The most common, though, are variants of the\\n“Palm-DOC” format, which is an open format and can be edited on the Palm itself.\\n\\n\\nPDF (FORMAT FOR EBOOKS)\\n\\nPortable Document Format is a format for storing texts, containing any fonts or\\ngraphics. It is copyrighted by Adobe, www.adobe.com [https://www.adobe.com] but\\nis well and publicly documented. It is sometimes referred to as a kind of\\ncompiled Postscript (see PS below). It is viewable using the Adobe Acrobat\\nReader and many other applications, including some free applications. It is not\\neasy to edit files in this format.\\n\\n\\nPRC (FORMAT FOR PDA-BASED EBOOKS)\\n\\nThis is a proprietary format for files that can be displayed only by the\\nMobiPocket Reader. See this archived website\\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20130116044910/http://www.mobipocket.com/en/HomePage/default.asp?Language=EN]\\nfor more information. It is not possible to edit or correct files in this\\nformat; it is not possible to export files from this format; they have to be\\nmade in another format and converted.\\n\\n\\nPS (FORMAT FOR TEXT AND GRAPHICS)\\n\\nPostscript is technically a programming language, not just a format. It has\\nconditional statements, procedures and program flow control. However, it is\\ncommonly referred to as a format. Adobe www.adobe.com [https://www.adobe.com]\\nholds copyright on the Postscript specifications (there have been three “levels”\\npublished) but Postscript is well and publicly documented and has wide support,\\nnot only in printing, but in screen display as well. Apart from Adobe’s official\\nversion, you can also render Postscript files with Ghostscript, a Free Software\\npackage. Postscript can be edited directly, but any complex editing may present\\ndifficulties.\\n\\n\\nRTF (FORMAT FOR TEXT)\\n\\nRich Text Format was originally a Microsoft specification, but it is an open\\nformat that is used by many word processors to exchange text and format\\ninformation in an application-independent way. Nearly all current word\\nprocessors will read and edit an RTF file, and, like HTML, it can also be edited\\nas plain text.\\n\\n\\nTXT\\n\\nTXT is a generic extension used for any plain text file, regardless of the\\ncharacter set. Thus, while most of our .TXT files contain ASCII, some contain\\nISO-8859 or Big-5 or Unicode.\\n\\n\\nTEX (FORMAT FOR TYPESETTING AND MATH)\\n\\nTeX (pronounced “tech”–the “X” is actually the Greek letter chi) is a public\\ndomain format created by Donald Knuth for typesetting, though it can also be\\nused for normal printing and viewing. It is the standard way to handle math\\ntexts and other documents containing a lot of technical symbols, since it has\\nreally good support for them. TeX consists mostly of the plain text, with\\ninstructions for how it is to be displayed. This is compiled into DVI format\\n(see above) which can be rendered onto any device, like a printer or screen, by\\na program that is aware of the device’s capabilities. Most commonly, TeX is\\ncompiled into PDF formats for viewing. The Comprehensive TeX Archive Network\\nwww.ctan.org [https://www.ctan.org/] is the best place to start looking for\\nTeX-related programs for your platform.\\n\\n\\nUNICODE/UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 (CHARACTER SET)\\n\\nUTF-8 is now the master format for plain text. Unicode is intended to be a\\nsingle character set that can handle all of the characters in all of the\\nlanguages that ever were, or ever will be. It accords with the ISO-10646\\nstandard for the characters, but, in addition, imposes rules of implementation.\\nUTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 and their variants are ways of implementing Unicode using\\ndifferent rules for transforming abstract code points into bytes. Unicode is\\nsteadily gaining ground, with at least some support in every major operating\\nsystem, but we’re nowhere near the point where everyone can just open a text\\nbased on Unicode and read and edit it. Generally, when we do post Unicode, we\\nuse the UTF-8 transformation format of it, since that is most commonly\\nsupported. Check www.unicode.org [https://www.unicode.org] for more.\\n\\n\\nXML (FORMAT FOR … WELL, JUST ABOUT ANYTHING :-)\\n\\neXtensible Markup Language looks a bit like HTML, but whereas tags have a\\nstandard meaning in HTML, XML allows anyone to define their own set of tags and\\nmeanings using a Document Type Definition (DTD) file. Add a CSS (Cascading Style\\nSheets) file to that, and you have the ability to display the text according to\\npredefined rules. Add some XSL (eXtensible Stylesheet Language) files and\\nconversion software, and you can automagically make other formats as well. In\\nprinciple, this seems to make it ideal for the storage and processing of etexts,\\nsince a suitable DTD and CSS and XSL, together with the right programs, should\\nmake it possible to produce any format of eBook automatically from an XML\\noriginal. Some PG volunteers have looked at, and are looking at, ways to convert\\nthe entire archive using a satisfactory DTD; however, meantime we aren’t\\nactually producing much XML, since most volunteers aren’t working with it, and\\nnobody wants to start producing many XML texts until we have agreed standards.\\nwww.w3.org/XML [https://www.w3.org/XML/] is the definitive source for more\\ninformation about XML.\\n\\n * Privacy policy [/policy/privacy_policy.html]\\n * About Project Gutenberg [/about/]\\n * Terms of Use [/policy/terms_of_use.html]\\n * Contact Information [/about/contact_information.html]\\n * Get Help [/help/]\\n\\niBiblio [/gutenberg/ibiblio-logo.png] https://www.ibiblio.org/\"}"}}
